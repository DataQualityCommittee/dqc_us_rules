# Satisfaction Period With No Satisfaction Start Date Axis
Rule ID: DQC_0077  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 10, 2018  
Effective date: January 1, 2019 

## Rule function 
This rule checks if the satisfaction period elements have been used with the following axis :

- RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionStartDateAxis

If the following two elements have reported fact values without the start date axis listed above then an error is produced. The two elements evaluated are :

- RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionPeriod
- RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionPeriod1

The first element applies to the 2017 taxonomy and the second element applies to the 2018 taxonomy.  

The rule produces an error for every occurance of a fact value using these elements that does not have the start date axis associated with it.  

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule identifies those cases where the satisfaction period elements are not used with the start date axis. Without this axis these elements have no meaning. This rule is intended to ensure that filers follow the guidance defined in the Revenue recognition implementation guide published by the FASB.  

## Example rule message

This axis must be used when reporting a value for us-gaap:RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionPeriod. Please refer to the FASB implementation guide on Revenue from Contracts with Customers  on the FASB website.
