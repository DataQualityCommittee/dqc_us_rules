# Management Defined Performance Measure Reconciliation Accuracy  
Rule ID: DQC.IFRS.0224.10751  
Status: Public Exposure December 8, 2025 - January 22, 2026 - provide comment at https://xbrl.us/public-review  
Public Review Release date: December 8, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC.IFRS.0224.10751 is to ensure the mathematical accuracy of management-defined performance measure (MPM) reconciliations in IFRS filings. The rule validates that the sum of the IFRS base measure and all reconciling adjustments equals the reported management-defined performance measure value. This ensures that reconciliation tables are mathematically consistent and that users can rely on the accuracy of the reconciliation from IFRS measures to management-defined performance measures.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all IFRS filings that include management-defined performance measure reconciliations using the ReconciliationOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureAxis.
- If a management-defined performance measure fact exists with the ValueOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureMember, the rule will verify mathematical accuracy.
- The rule checks that: IFRS base measure + sum(reconciling adjustments) = Management-defined performance measure

**Technical Details**
The rule performs the following validation:
1. **Identifies MPM Facts**: Locates monetary facts tagged with the ValueOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureMember
2. **Identifies IFRS Base**: Finds the corresponding IFRS measure on the reconciliation domain
3. **Collects Adjustments**: Gathers all reconciling item facts (excluding the domain and MPM member)
4. **Validates Arithmetic**: Ensures that IFRS base + sum(adjustments) = MPM value

**Axis and Members**
The rule works with the following IFRS taxonomy elements:
- **Axis**: ifrs-full:ReconciliationOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureAxis
- **Target Member**: ifrs-full:ValueOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureMember
- **Domain**: ReconciliationOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureDomain
- **Excluded Member**: AllReconcilingItemsMember

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where management-defined performance measure reconciliations contain mathematical errors or inconsistencies. Such errors can mislead users about the relationship between IFRS measures and management-defined performance measures, undermining the credibility of non-IFRS financial metrics. The rule ensures that reconciliation tables are arithmetically correct, providing users with reliable information about how management-defined measures relate to standardized IFRS measures.

## Example Rule Message

Management defined performance measure reconciliation mismatch.

MPM fact: 150000
MPM period: 2024-01-01/2024-12-31
MPM unit: USD
MPM dimensions: ifrs-full:ReconciliationOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureAxis=ifrs-full:ValueOfManagementdefinedPerformanceMeasureMember

IFRS base used: 120000
Sum of adjustments: 25000

Expected: IFRS base + sum(adjustments) = MPM

Please review the facts used in the reconciliation: the IFRS measure facts on the Reconciliation domain and the reconciling item facts.
