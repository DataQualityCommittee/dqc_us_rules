# Misapplication of Concepts between Investing, Financing and Operating Activities
  
## Rule function  
The rule identifies inappropriate calculation descendants of investing, financing or operating items in the company's extension filing for the statement of cash flows. This rule identifies the calculation children of investing, financing or operating elements in the calculation linkbase of the IFRS taxonomy and compares the set of elements to the calculation children used in the company's extension calculation linkbase. The rule creates a set of elements from the IFRS taxonomy (under each category) and compares the set to the children of the element in the extension taxonomy and flags an error if the two sets intersect. This rule compares the sets listed in the index below.
