If any of these items appear as a descendant of Investing Activities, then an error is flagged.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers are building the presentation linkbases correctly.  WIth the adoption of inline XBRL, many filers no longer review the SEC renderer.  This rule is intended to identify those issues that arise that would not be obvious from looking at the inline filing but would be obvious when looking at the SEC renderer.
