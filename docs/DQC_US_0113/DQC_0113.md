# Gross Acquisition Less Than Net Acquisition  
Rule ID: DQC_0113  
Status: Final
Release date: June 29, 2021
Effective date: September 1, 2021
  
## Rule function
This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company reports the total "Payments To Acquire Businesses Gross" with an amount that is less than the value of "Payments To Acquire Businesses Net Of Cash Acquired". The value of the gross payments should always exceed the net payments. The rule excludes nil values and will only run when both values are present in the same context. The rule takes into account decimals when performing the comparison. The smallest decimal of the two values is used for the comparison.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule ensures that filers use the correct elements to identify the Gross Payments and the Net Payments for business acquisitions.
