If the business acquisition axis is not associated with a fact using one of these elements then an error is reported. An error is reported for every instance of a fact.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule ensures that filers identify the business acquisition associated with each of the above line item concepts. Each of these concepts should **not** be reported in the default as the concept's meaning is ambiguous if not associated with a specific business combination.

### Example rule message
The company has reported a value of  10 for the concept us-gaap:BusinessAcquisitionSharePrice. It is expected that this fact also uses the BusinessAcquisitionAxis with a member indicating the business acquisition that the fact was related to.  This fact must include the business acquisition axis (BusinessAcquisitionAxis).

The properties of this us-gaap:BusinessAcquisitionSharePrice fact are:

Period: 2019-11-09
Dimensions: us-gaap:TypeOfArrangementAxis=svac:OptionalSharePurchaseAgreementMember
Unit: USD/shares

Rule Element ID: 9561
Rule version: 15.0.0RC1
