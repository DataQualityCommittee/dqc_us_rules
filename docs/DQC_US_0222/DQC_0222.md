# Scaling Error in EntityPublicFloat  
Rule ID: DQC_0222  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0222 is to ensure that the value reported for `dei:EntityPublicFloat` is correctly scaled and falls within a reasonable range for both standard and small business filers. The rule checks for likely scaling errors, such as values that are implausibly large or small, which may indicate that the value was reported in the wrong units (e.g., thousands or millions instead of dollars). This helps prevent misstatements in public float disclosures and promotes accurate, reliable reporting.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all filings that report a value for `dei:EntityPublicFloat`.  
- For standard filers, the rule triggers an error if the value is greater than $10 trillion or less than $1 million.
- For small business filers (`dei:EntitySmallBusiness` is true), the rule triggers an error if the value is greater than $250 million or less than $1,000.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers report public float values that are likely incorrect due to scaling errors. Such errors can result in misleading disclosures and affect regulatory thresholds and investor analysis. By flagging values outside reasonable ranges, the rule helps filers identify and correct scaling mistakes before submission.

## Example Rule Message

The value reported for dei:EntityPublicFloat appears to have a scaling error. The value reported is 500. Please check that the value is reported in the correct units (e.g., dollars, not thousands or millions).
