Rule ID: DQC_0162  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 5, 2023  
Effective date: December 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where the filer has used an invalid or inconsistent trading symbol.  The rule checks that the trading symbol does not include invalid characters, identifies if the symbol is not applicable, and the symbol is upper case. 

The rule flags an error if the trading symbol includes the characters such as " , * ,&, @,%, !, ^,# and $.  The rule also checks if the text used to indicate if a trading symbol is not applicable is appropriate.  If any of the following strings are used 'N/A', 'n/a', '-', 'NONE', 'NOT APPLICABLE' then an error message is displayed. The rule will flag if any of the letters comprising the symbol are lower case. Finally the rule checks that if the symbol NA is used then the cik of the filing must be 0001872302.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers use consistent trading symbols from filing to filing and that inappropriate symbols are not used so that users of the data can effectively search for filings based on the trading symbol.    

### Example rule message

The trading symbol cannot contain special characters such as ",@,*,&,!,$, %,#,^ or Invalid Tickers such as N/A, n/a, -, NONE, NOT APPLICABLE and should be entered as an upper-case value.
