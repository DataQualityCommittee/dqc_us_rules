# Plan Asset Dimensional Aggregation
Rule ID: DQC_0070  
Status: Draft for Committee Review  
Release date: TBD  

## Rule function 
This rule aggregates the values of the Plan Asset categories on the DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis for the element DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets. The rule aggregates the values of the members and compares the total to the reported total for the default value of the axis. The rule aggregates the descendant members of the axis but excludes those members that have a parent with a reported value.  This ensures that values associated with descendant members are not double counted.

In addition, the rule has a built in tolerance that is related to the decimals of the values compared. The rule takes the decimal value of the reported total and uses that as a base. This base is converted to an accuracy level and multiplied by 2 to give a tolerance level. For example, if the reported total has a decimals value of -6, this represents an accuracy of 1 million. This is multiplied by 2 to give 2 million.  When the values of the reported total and aggregate total are compared there is an allowable difference of 2 million.  If the reported total has decimals of infinite then the aggregated value must match exactly.

Note that the decimals of the aggregated values are not tracked and maintained.

If no value is reported for the total then the rule will not run. If the value of the total is reported as nil; then the rule will not run.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule identifies those cases where a filer has not nested the plan asset categories appropriately on the plan asset categories axis.  It will also identify where other disclosures are made in the footnote that should have used the element DefinedBenefitPlanPlanAssetsInvestmentWithinPlanAssetCategoryAmount to report sub-components of plan assets that cannot be aggregated.

## Example rule message
The concept DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets with a defaulted value of 52,694,000,000 is not equal to the dimensionally qualified value with the DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis which has an aggregate value of 4,683,000,000.

Which is comprised of the following:

> PrivateEquityFundsAndRealEstateMember --> 4,683,000,000

The value of a concept broken down by its components along a given axis should  be equal to its component pieces. Please check that either the default value of 52,694,000,000 is correct for DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets or that correct dimensions have been defined.

This rule aggregates the value of member components located on the axis at the highest level of aggregation to avoid double counting in the event that the company uses a hierarchy of members.

## For Developers
The [Global Rule Logic document](https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/master/docs/GlobalRuleLogic.md) contains general guidelines for implementation of rules.

The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter's value is to occur.

### Message template
The concept DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets with a defaulted value of {$FairValueOfPlanAssets} is not equal to the dimensionally qualified with the DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis which has an aggregate value of {$member_sum}.

Which is comprised of the following:
{$member_string}

The value of a concept broken down by its components along the DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis axis should  be equal to its component pieces. Please check that either the default value of {$FairValueOfPlanAssets} is correct for DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets or that correct dimensions have been defined. In the case where the filer has reported a sub component of plan assets but not a complete breakdown then the element DefinedBenefitPlanPlanAssetsInvestmentWithinPlanAssetCategoryAmount should be used instead of the element DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets.

This rule aggregates the value of member components located on the axis at the highest level of aggregation to avoid double counting in the event that the company uses a hierarchy of members.
