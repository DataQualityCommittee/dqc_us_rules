# ECD Rule 10b51 Flag Disclosures  
Rule ID: DQC_0170  
Status: Final  
Release date: January 16, 2024  
Effective date: May 16, 2024  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where the filer has not reported the ECD Rule 10b51 Flag Disclosures that should be reported with a value of false if they had no such disclosures to make. The rule identifies if this flag is not reported in 10-K filings with a document period end date after 2023-12-31. The rule checks if the following 4 flags defined in the ECD taxonomy are missing:

 *  Rule10b51ArrAdoptedFlag,
 *  NonRule10b51ArrAdoptedFlag,
 *  Rule10b51ArrTrmntdFlag,
 *  NonRule10b51ArrTrmntdFlag

## Problem solved by the rule  
The SEC ECD taxonomy requires that these 4 flags are tagged even if the values are false. This rule checks that this disclosure has been made.    

### Example rule message
The element Rule10b51ArrAdoptedFlag is a required disclosure after 12/21/2023. Please report the boolean flag value for this element.  

Rule Element ID: 10103  
Rule version: 23.0.0RC1
