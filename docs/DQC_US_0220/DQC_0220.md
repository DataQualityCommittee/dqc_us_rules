Rule ID: DQC_0220  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0220 is to ensure that filers do not use the `StatementTable` element in the notes disclosures section of their filings. The `StatementTable` is intended to be used only in the face financial statements, not in the notes. This rule checks for instances where the `StatementTable` is used in the notes and instructs filers to use the appropriate table name for notes disclosures, promoting proper taxonomy usage and consistency in XBRL filings.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all filings that include note disclosures.  
- If the `StatementTable` element is used in any note disclosure cube, the rule will trigger an error.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers incorrectly use the `StatementTable` element in the notes section, which can lead to confusion, improper data structuring, and reduced comparability across filings. By enforcing the correct usage of table elements, the rule ensures clarity and uniformity in the representation of financial statement and note data.

## Example Rule Message

The filing has used the StatementTable in the notes in the role Notes - Disclosure - 2025. The StatementTable is not intended to be used in the notes, it is intended to be used in the face financial statements. The filer should use the appropriate table name for the notes disclosure.
