# Transition Tax Elements  
Rule ID:  DQC_0086  
Status: Final  
Release date: February 12, 2020  
Effective date: May 15, 2020  

## Rule function  
This rule identifies where filers have used tax elements that are no longer applicable because of changes in the accounting standards related to taxation. 
  
The rule works by identifying all elements that are children of the abstract element _ASU201517TransitionAbstract_ in the 2019 taxonomy.  Any values that use the elements in this list are reported as an error.  This rule is applicable for the 2018 and 2019 taxonomy only as users of these taxonomies are expected to have transitioned to the updated accounting standards.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule ensures that filers are using the appropriate tax elements in their filing.  

## Example rule message  
The element DeferredTaxAssetsGrossCurrent with a value of $3,000,000 has been used in the filing.  This element is a transition element and is intended to be used in periods before adoption of amendments from Accounting Standards Update 2015-17. The element should no longer be used for filings with fiscal years beginning after December 15th 2016.
