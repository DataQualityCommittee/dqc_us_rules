# Axis with Inappropriate Members  
  
## Rule function
Certain axes in the IFRS taxonomy should only have certain members as shown in the IFRS taxonomy. This rule tests whether these axes have inappropriate members.  

Certain axes can have custom or extended (i.e., company specific) members. This rule also tests whether only these axes have custom members and, therefore, limits the use of custom or extended members to those situations where they are appropriate because the member is unique to the filer. 

The rule evaluates a company's _extension taxonomy_ and flags an error when there is an inappropriate axis/member combination in the extension taxonomy, even if that combination is not used by any facts in the report.

## Data Quality Guidance 
This rule verifies compliance with [DQC Guidance on Tagging Axis and Members Using the IFRS Taxonomy](https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/documentation/blob/master/guidance/tagging-ifrs.md).

## Problem solved by the rule
If certain axes have inappropriate standard members, consumption of the data is adversely impacted because the resulting axis and member combinations are nonsensical, e.g., reporting a type of currency as a member on a debt instrument axis. 

If an axis has inappropriate custom or extended elements for members that are not unique to the filer, automated analysis is more difficult because the use of these members is not expected on the axis. 

Consumers, in certain circumstances, can use a standard axis to understand the nature of extension members. For example, if a company reports the values of underlying individual securities comprising equity or fixed income securities but does not report a subtotal for fixed income or equity securities, the nature of individual securities represented as extensions would be understood because the extensions would be represented as a component of the standard elements for equity or fixed income securities.  If the company uses a standard member that is not a type of investment security it is impossible to understand the nature of the extensions used for underlying individual securities.   

## Rule specification

For each dimension listed below, any dimension member that is _defined for use_ on that dimension in the _extension taxonomy_ MUST either be _defined for use_ on that same dimension in the _base taxonomy_ or be in the set of exceptions for the dimension listed below.

A member is _defined for use_ on a dimension if it is in the set of members that can be found by following dimension-domain and then domain-member relationships from that dimension, starting in any extended link role and following the rules of [Dimensional Relationship Set](https://www.xbrl.org/specification/dimensions/rec-2012-01-25/dimensions-rec-2006-09-18+corrected-errata-2012-01-25-clean.html#term-dimensional-relationship-set) traversal.

This rule is not applied to any dimension for which the dimension default has been changed (see [DQC.IFRS.0041](../DQC_IFRS_0041/DQC_0041.md)).

Note that this check is performed even if no facts in the report make use of the disallowed member.

## Example rule message<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>  
There are two message types associated with this rule.  The first two messages report  when there is a fact associated with the axis member combination and the third message is reported when no fact is associated with the axis and member combination. 

The rule message associated with an inappropriate extended member on an axis associated with a fact is as follows:

> The concept Revenue with a value of 15,531,000,000 is dimensionally qualified with the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis and the unallowable member IntersegmentMember. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members: ifrs-full:EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember, ifrs-full:UnallocatedAmountsMember, ifrs-full:OperatingSegmentsMember, ifrs-full:MaterialReconcilingItemsMember, ifrs-full:EntitysTotalForSegmentConsolidationItemsMember.  

> The properties of this ifrs-full:Revenue fact are:  
> Period: 2016-01-01 to 2016-12-31  
> Dimensions: ifrs-full:SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis=pbr:IntersegmentMember  
> Unit: USD 
>    
> Rule Element ID: 9554  
> Rule version: 16.0

The rule message associated with a member from the IFRS taxonomy used with an inappropriate axis is as follows:

> The concept NonoperatingIncomeExpense1 with a value of 12,000,000 is dimensionally qualified with the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis and the unallowable member InvestmentsAccountedForUsingEquityMethodMember. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members:, ifrs-full:UnallocatedAmountsMember, ifrs-full:EntitysTotalForSegmentConsolidationItemsMember, ifrs-full:EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember, ifrs-full:MaterialReconcilingItemsMember, ifrs-full:OperatingSegmentsMember, OperatingSegmentsExcludingIntersegmentEliminationMember or IntersubsegmentEliminationsMember.

> The properties of this ifrs-full:NonoperatingIncomeExpense1 fact are:  
> Period: 2017-01-01 to 2017-12-31  
> Dimensions: ifrs-full:SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis=ifrs-full:InvestmentsAccountedForUsingEquityMethodMember  
> Unit: USD  
>    
> Rule Element ID: 9554  
> Rule version: 16.0
 
The rule message associated with an inappropriate axis member combination where there is no associated fact, is as follows:

> The member OperatingSegmentsAndUnallocatedMember is used on the axis SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members: ifrs-full:OperatingSegmentsMember, ifrs-full:MaterialReconcilingItemsMember, ifrs-full:EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember, ifrs-full:UnallocatedAmountsMember, ifrs-full:EntitysTotalForSegmentConsolidationItemsMember. There are no facts associated with this member and axis.

### General message template  
The rule template associated with an inappropriate extended member on an axis associated with a fact is as follows:

> The concept {$fact1.concept.name.local-name} with a value of {$fact1} is dimensionally qualified with the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis and the unallowable member {$member.local-name}. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members: {$allowed_members.join(', ')}.

> The properties of the fact for {$fact1.concept.name.local-name} are:  
> Period: {$fact1.period} 
> Dimensions: {$fact1.dimensions.join(', ','=')}  
> Unit: {$fact1.unit}

The rule template associated with a member from the IFRS taxonomy used with an inappropriate axis is as follows:

> The concept {$fact1.concept.name.local-name} with a value of {$fact1} is dimensionally qualified with the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis and the unallowable member {$member.local-name}. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members: {$allowed_members.join(', ')}. 

> The properties of the fact for {$fact1.concept.name.local-name} are:  
> Period: {$fact1.period}  
> Dimensions: {$fact1.dimensions.join(', ','=')}  
> Unit: {$fact1.unit}

The rule message associated with an inappropriate axis member combination where there is no associated fact, is as follows:

> The member {$member.local-name} is used on the axis SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis. The SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis should only be used with the following members: {$allowed_members.sort.join(', ')}. There are no facts associated with this member and axis.
