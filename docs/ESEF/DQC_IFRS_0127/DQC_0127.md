# Incorrect Dimensional Item Used on Financial Statements  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies those cases where the dimensional structures defined for the financial statements in the company provided definition linkbase do not match the actual values reported. The rule checks all networks that contain the abstract elements StatementOfFinancialPositionAbstract, IncomeStatementAbstract and StatementOfCashFlowsAbstract. It excludes any statements that are not the Statement of Financial Position , Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows. The Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity is not covered by this rule.

The rule has two components.  The first component checks those statements where no dimensions are defined and the second component checks those statements where dimensions are defined.

**Component 1**
For the first component the rule only operates on those financial statements that do **__not__** define an XBRL table with dimensions to represent values on the statement. This rule checks if a definition linkbase is defined for the statement. If it is not then the rule will proceed to execute. 

The rule then checks if each concept in the presentation linkbase for the financial statement has a default fact value defined in the current reporting period. The rule then checks if there is a dimensionalized value for the same concept.

The rule reports an error if the presentation concept has no default value in the current reporting period but does have dimensionalized values for the concept reported in the filing.

**Component 2**
For the second component the rule only operates on those financial statements that do define an XBRL table with dimensions to represent values on the statement. This rule checks if a definition linkbase is defined for the statement. If it is then the rule will proceed to execute. 

The rule then checks if each concept in the presentation linkbase for the financial statement has  dimensionalized fact values defined in the current reporting period. The rule then checks if any of these dimensionalized values can exist in the financial statement as defined by the definition linkbase.

The rule reports an error if the presentation concept has no dimensionalized value that is appropriate for the table defined representing that financial statement.

This rule only applies to those facts that are reported in the company's current reporting context. This means prior periods are not checked. This eliminates the possibility of generating false positives on incomplete periods. It is assumed that the current context for each statement includes all the facts to make each report a complete calculation set. The current context is based on the periods reported for the first fact encountered from the following elements:

* NameOfReportingEntityOrOtherMeansOfIdentification
* LegalFormOfEntity
* DomicileOfEntity
* CountryOfIncorporation
* AddressOfRegisteredOfficeOfEntity
* PeriodCoveredByFinancialStatements
* DescriptionOfPresentationCurrency
* DateOfEndOfReportingPeriod2013

## Problem solved by the rule
In a number of cases filers use dimensionalized values on the face of the financial statements, but neglect to include a related definition linkbase that matches the reporting of the dimensionalized item on the face financial statement. This is important for data users, especially when interpreting financial statements where dimensions have been used to disaggregate data. In these cases the definition linkbase is used to determine the facts included in the financial statements. If the definition linkbase is incorrect, or the presentation linkbase is incorrect, it becomes impossible to identify the values that were reported on these statements.

### Example rule message 1
The statement 1001001 - Statement - Statement of comprehensive income, profit or loss, by nature of expense (Statement) includes the concept ifrs-full:ProfitLossBeforeTax in the presentation tree. The filing does not include a dimensional structure for this statement.  The filing  does not include a  default value for this presentation item ifrs-full:ProfitLossBeforeTax but does include dimensionalized values for this element of the following:

20,390,000

If the dimensionalized value appears in the financial statements, then a dimension needs to be added to the report. If the item has no value on the financial statements, then the presentation item should be removed from the financial statements.

Total Element : ifrs-full:ProfitLossBeforeTax
Total period : 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31 
Dimensions : ifrs-full:SegmentsAxis=middlesea:NonTechnicalAccountMember

Rule Element Id:9596
Rule version: 18.0.0RC1

### Example rule message 2
The statement 1001001 - Statement - Statement of comprehensive income, profit or loss, by nature of expense (Statement)  includes the concept ifrs-full:DepreciationPropertyPlantAndEquipment in the presentation tree. The filing includes a dimensional table to represent this statement. The filing does not include a valid dimensional structure for the presentation item ifrs-full:DepreciationPropertyPlantAndEquipment. The concept has the following values associated with it in the filing :

130,697,000

None of these values however, are valid for the financial statement table. If the value appears in the financial statements, then either a dimension or line item needs to be added to the structure of the definition linkbase that defines the report. If the item is not represented on the financial statements, then the presentation item should be removed.

In this case the concept DepreciationPropertyPlantAndEquipment is missing from the definition linkbase and should be added.

Total Element: ifrs-full:DepreciationPropertyPlantAndEquipment  
Total period: 2021-01-01 to 2021-06-30  
Dimensions:  
  
Rule Element ID: 9592  
Rule version: 17.0.0RC1 

### General message template 1 
The statement {$presNetwork.role.description} includes the concept {$concept_item} in the presentation tree. The filing does not include a dimensional structure for this statement.  The filing  does not include a  default value for this presentation item {$concept_item} but does include dimensionalized values for this element of the following:

{$dimensionValues.sort.join(',   ')}

If the dimensionalized value appears in the financial statements, then a dimension needs to be added to the report. If the item has no value on the financial statements, then the presentation item should be removed from the financial statements.

Total Element: {$concept_item}  
Total period: {first($dimensionValues).period}   
Dimensions: {first($dimensionValues).dimensions.join(', ','=')}  
  
Rule Element ID: {$rule_id}  
Rule version: {$ruleVersion} 
  
### General message template 2
The statement {$presNetwork.role.description} includes the concept {$concept_item} in the presentation tree. The filing includes a dimensional table to represent  this statement.  The filing  does not include a valid dimensional structure for the presentation item {$concept_item}. The concept has the following values associated with it in the filing :

{$dimensionValues.sort.join(',   ')}

None of these values however, are valid for the financial statement table. If the value appears in the financial statements, then either a dimension or line item needs to be added to the structure of the definition linkbase that defines the report. If the item is not represented on the financial statements, then the presentation item should be removed.
{if $is_concept_in_table.length == 0 '
In this case the concept ' + $concept_item.local-name + ' is missing from the definition linkbase and should be added.' else ''}

Total Element: {$concept_item}  
Total period: {first($dimensionValues).period}   
Dimensions: {first($dimensionValues).dimensions.join(', ','=')}
