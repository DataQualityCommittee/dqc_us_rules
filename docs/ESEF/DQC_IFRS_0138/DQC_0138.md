# Missing Abstract from Financial Statements  
  
## Rule function
This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company reports a financial statement but does not include an abstract element that indicates what type of financial statement the role applies to.  The ESEF taxonomy requires that each of the following statements use a statement abstract as the root element: 

|Financial Statement|Required Root Abstract|
|--- |--- |
|Statement Of Financial Position|StatementOfFinancialPositionAbstract|
|Income Statement or Statement Of Comprehensive Income|StatementOfComprehensiveIncomeAbstract or IncomeStatementAbstract|
|Statement Of Cash Flows|StatementOfCashFlowsAbstract|

This rule checks that at least one of the above abstract elements appears as the root element in the presentation tree.  The rule reports an error if it cannot find these elements as a root element somewhere in a presentation role. Only these elements are checked as the filers must report each of these statements in the ESEF submission.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule makes sure that it is possible to identify which financial statement each role represents. This allows other rules to run on specific roles based on what type of financial statement it is. The ESEF taxonomy also requires that fileres identify the financial statements by using these abstract items.

### Example rule message

According to ESMA filing rules this abstract item must be reported as the root element of a Income Statement or StatementOfComprehensiveIncomeAbstract appearing in the filing.
