Rule ID: DQC.IFRS.0223.10709  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC.IFRS.0223.10709 is to ensure that extension concepts used as leaf items (i.e., items with no calculation children) on the statement of operating activities or income statement are appropriately named. Specifically, the rule requires that such extension concepts include one of the following terms in their local name: "operating", "investing", "financing", "incometax", or "discontinuedoperation". This promotes clarity and consistency in financial statement presentation and helps users understand the nature of extension items. The strings are case insensitive, meaning that "Operating", "OPERATING", and "operating" are all considered valid.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all IFRS filings that include extension concepts as leaf items in the statement of operating activities or income statement presentation linkbase.  
- If an extension concept is a leaf item and its local name does not contain one of the required terms, the rule will trigger an error.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where extension concepts are used as leaf items on the statement of operating activities or income statement but are not clearly identified as relating to operating, investing, financing, income tax, or discontinued operations. Such omissions can lead to unclear or ambiguous financial disclosures. The rule ensures that extension concepts are properly named, improving transparency and comparability.

## Example Rule Message

The extension concept myCompany:OtherIncome is used as a leaf item on the statement of operating activities or income statement but does not include one of the required strings: operating, investing, financing, incometax, or discontinuedoperation. Please revise the concept name to include one of these terms or ensure it is not a leaf item.
