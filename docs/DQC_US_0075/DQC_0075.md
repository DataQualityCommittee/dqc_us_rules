## Rule function 
This rule identifies cases where the filer has disclosed a revenue recognition policy indicating that sales and excise taxes are excluded from revenues. (RevenueTransactionPriceMeasurementTaxExclusionPolicyTextBlock) It then checks if the element that indicates revenues including sales and excise taxes are included in the filing (RevenueFromContractWithCustomerIncludingAssessedTax) and that the element used for revenue excluding sales tax is not included in the filing. (RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax) If all these conditions are met, then the rule produces an error. An error is produced for every occurence of the element RevenueFromContractWithCustomerIncludingAssessedTax.

No errors are produced if the element RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax is used and the element for the text block (RevenueTransactionPriceMeasurementTaxExclusionPolicyTextBlock) is not used.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule identifies those cases where the inappropriate revenue element is used in conjunction with the tax exclusion policy text block. If the company has used the element RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax the tax polcy element does not have to be completed.
