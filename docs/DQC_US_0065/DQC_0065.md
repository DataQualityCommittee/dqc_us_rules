# Interest Paid Net (Operating) Not on Cash Flow
Rule ID: DQC_0065  
Status:  Final  
Release date: OCtober 4, 2017  
Effective date: April 2, 2018  

## Rule function

This rule identifies those cases where the filer has included the element InterestPaid as a presentation linkbase descendant of the element SupplementalCashFlowInformationAbstract but has not included the element InterestPaidNet and the element InterestPaidCapitalized as a presentation linkbase descendant of the element SupplementalCashFlowInformationAbstract. The rule reports a separate error for every default value (values with no dimensions) other than zero is included in the instance document.

## Problem solved by the rule

This rule supports the recommendations of the cash flow guidance. The FASB codification requires that filers who report their cash flows using the indirect method publish their interest paid during the period net of any interest paid for capital expenses. This represents the interest paid applicable to operating activities and the interest capitalized represents the interest paid applicable to investing activities. This rule helps to ensure that companies use the element InterestPaidNet instead of the element InterestPaid.

## Example rule message

The Supplemental cash flow section has reported a value of 148,203 for the element InterestPaid but the element InterestPaidNet is not included in the supplemental cash flow section. Interest paid, net of the capitalized component must be reported in this section.
