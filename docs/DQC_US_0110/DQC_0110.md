# Missing Business Acquisition Axis (Short Period)  
Rule ID: DQC_0110  
Status: Final
Release date: June 29, 2021
Effective date: September 1, 2021
  
## Rule function
This rule will flag errors for those cases where the company has not used the Business Acquisition Axis. The rule looks for those cases where the element BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1 has been used with no dimensions but has been reported with a duration period less than the reporting period by 20 days. The reporting period is based on the period of the dei element, DocumentPeriodEndDate. Errors are produced for every fact occurrence for the concept BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1 where the date is less than the reporting period by more than 20 days.

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule identifies where the company has reported the details of a specific acquisition but has not identified the actual acquisition. It also identifies those cases where the aggregate consideration transferred for the reporting period has not been reported using appropriate dates.

### Example rule message
The company has reported a value of  64,100,000 as the default value paid for acquisitions. This represents all acquisitions during the period.  However the period is for 1 day(s), which is less than the reporting period, based on the document period end date.  If the amount represents a specific acquisition then the business acquisition axis must be used.

The properties of this us-gaap:BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1 fact are:

Period: 2019-05-21 to 2019-05-21
