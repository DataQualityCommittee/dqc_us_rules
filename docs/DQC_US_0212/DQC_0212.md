# Missing Shares Issued or Authorized Facts When Shares Outstanding Reported
Rule ID: DQC_0212  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0212 is to ensure that when a filer reports facts for shares outstanding (such as `CommonStockSharesOutstanding` or `SharesOutstanding`), they also report the corresponding facts for shares issued and shares authorized, as appropriate. This rule validates that filings do not omit required facts that provide a complete picture of a company's equity structure. If shares outstanding and shares issued (or authorized) are the same, both concepts should be tagged. If shares authorized are unlimited, the appropriate "unlimited" concept should be used.

**Conditions:**

The rule runs on all filings that report facts for shares outstanding or common stock shares outstanding.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

The problem solved by Rule DQC_0212 is ensuring that all required facts related to shares issued and shares authorized are reported when shares outstanding are present. Omitting these facts can lead to incomplete or unclear disclosures about a company's equity, making it difficult for users of the financial statements to understand the full equity structure. This rule ensures that all necessary facts are included, promoting accurate and complete tagging of equity data.
