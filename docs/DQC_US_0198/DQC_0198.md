**Conditions:**

The document type must be 10-K or 10-KT.
The document period end date must be on or after December 15, 2025.

**Logic:**

For each concept in the set of equivalent tax rates ($EQUIVALENT_TAX_RATES), check if a monetary value exists but the equivalent percentage amount is missing.

**Message:**

Informs the filer that a monetary value has been reported without the corresponding percentage amount and provides details about the missing concept.

### Rule 2: US.0198.10651

**Purpose:** 

Ensures that if a percentage value for tax is provided in a 10-K filing, an equivalent monetary amount must also be provided.

**Conditions:**

The document type must be 10-K or 10-KT.
The document period end date must be on or after December 15, 2025.

**Logic:**

For each concept in the set of equivalent tax rates ($EQUIVALENT_TAX_RATES), check if both the percentage value and the equivalent monetary amount exist.

**Message:**

Informs the filer that a percentage value has been reported without the corresponding monetary amount and provides details about the missing concept.

### Rule 3: US.0198.10652

**Purpose:**

Ensures that the reported percentage value for tax is correctly calculated based on the monetary values provided.

**Conditions:**

This rule runs on all document types for all periods.

**Logic:**

Calculate the base income by dividing the tax amount (`IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`) by the effective income tax rate (`EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations`).
For each concept in the set of equivalent tax rates ($EQUIVALENT_TAX_RATES), calculate the expected percentage value by dividing the monetary value by the base income.
Compare the calculated percentage value with the reported percentage value, allowing for a small tolerance.

**Message:**

Informs the filer if the reported percentage value does not match the calculated value and provides details about the discrepancy.
Suggests changing the decimal values if they are set to infinity.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

The rule broadly solves the problem of ensuring consistency and accuracy in the reporting of tax-related values in financial statements, specifically in 10-K filings. Here are the key aspects of the problem it addresses:

**Scenario 1:**

A company reports a monetary value for income tax expense but fails to provide the corresponding effective income tax rate as a percentage.

**Scenario 2:**

A company reports an effective income tax rate but does not provide the corresponding monetary value for income tax expense.

**Scenario 3:** 

The reported effective income tax rate does not match the calculated rate based on the provided monetary values, indicating a potential error in the financial statements.
