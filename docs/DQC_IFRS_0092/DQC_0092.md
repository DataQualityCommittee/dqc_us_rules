# IFRS Non Positive Items  

## Rule description

This rule identifies where reports include a positive value for an item that should be negative.  The rule consists of two sub components: The first checks that values using the Elimination Of Intersegment Amounts Member have a negative value. The second checks that certain elements used with the Carrying Amount Accumulated Depreciation Amortisation And Impairment And Gross Carrying Amount Axis and Accumulated Depreciation Members always have a negative value.


## Problem solved by the rule
The intent of the rule is to identify those facts that have been entered with a positive value when the value in fact should have been a negative amount.

## Rule description 

### Part 1

Let **non-positive excluded axis/member pairs** be the following set of axis/member combinations:

* CarryingAmountAccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentAndGrossCarryingAmountAxis
    * AccumulatedImpairmentMember
    * AccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentMember
    * AccumulatedDepreciationAndAmortisationMember
* RetrospectiveApplicationAndRetrospectiveRestatementAxis
    * IncreaseDecreaseDueToChangesInAccountingPolicyAndCorrectionsOfPriorPeriodErrorsMember
    * FinancialEffectOfChangesInAccountingPolicyMember
    * IncreaseDecreaseDueToChangesInAccountingPolicyRequiredByIFRSsMember
    * IncreaseDecreaseDueToVoluntaryChangesInAccountingPolicyMember
    * FinancialEffectOfCorrectionsOfAccountingErrorsMember
* FinancialEffectOfTransitionFromPreviousGAAPToIFRSsAxis
    * EffectOfTransitionToIFRSsMember
* RedesignationAxis
    * RedesignatedAmountMember
* FairValueAsDeemedCostAxis
    * AggregateAdjustmentToCarryingValueReportedUnderPreviousGAAPMember
* DepartureFromRequirementOfIFRSAxis,
    * IncreaseDecreaseDueToDepartureFromRequirementOfIFRSMember
* ComponentsOfEquityAxis
    * TreasurySharesMember
* TypesOfRisksAxis
    * RiskDiversificationEffectMember
* AmountsArisingFromInsuranceContractsAxis
    * ReinsurersShareOfAmountArisingFromInsuranceContractsMember
* NetDefinedBenefitLiabilityAssetAxis
    * PresentValueOfDefinedBenefitObligationMember
    * PlanAssetsMember
    * EffectOfAssetCeilingMember

Let **non-positive sub-string exclusions** be the following set of strings:

* adjust
* consolidat
* netting
* reconcili
* reclass
* change
* increasedecreas

Let **excluded axes** be as defined in DQC0080.

For each fact with a concept in the list of **non-negative concepts** defined in DQC.IFRS.0080, and a value of EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember for the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis, the value MUST be less than or equal to zero unless:

* the fact has a dimension with a non-default value that is in the set of **non-positive excluded axis/member pairs**; or
* the fact has a dimension and member that is in the set of **excluded axes**; or 
* any string in **non-positive sub-string exclusions** is a case-insensitive substring of the local name of any non-default dimension member applied to the fact.

### Part 2

The second rule takes a list of asset related elements and checks that any values reported for these elements and the axis  CarryingAmountAccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentAndGrossCarryingAmountAxis used with any of the following members is always negative:

  1. AccumulatedImpairmentMember
  1. AccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentMember
  1. AccumulatedDepreciationAndAmortisationMember

This rule also excludes those facts that have additional dimensions and members that are known to flip the sign of a value.  This list of axis members and axis member combinations is the same list that is used for the non neg rule DQC.IFRS.0080.
