# Incorrect Transition Elements Used  
Rule ID: DQC_0121  
Status: Approved  
Release date: September 29, 2021   
Effective date: December 1, 2021  
  
## Rule function
This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company reports line items that have been transitioned because of changes in accounting standards.  These transition elements remain in the taxonomy so that certain filers can continue to use them. The rule identifies those filers that should not be using the elements and reports the results to the user. The rule is composed of two sub rules.  The first rule identifies transition elements that should no longer be used.  These are identified as descendants of the following abstract concepts in the US-GAAP 2020 and 2021 taxonomies:

*   ASU201601TransitionAbstract
*   ASU201618TransitionAbstract

The second component of the rule reports errors when transition elements are used by companies other than emerging growth companies. The second rule identifies transition elements that should no longer be used.  These are identified as descendants of the following abstract concepts in the US-GAAP 2020 and 2021 taxonomies:

*   ASU201602TransitionAbstract
*   ASU201712TransitionAbstract
*   ASU201807TransitionAbstract

The second rule allows some elements that are descendants of these abstract elements to be used. The exception elements that are excluded from the rule are as follows:

*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalRemainderOfFiscalYear
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsRepaymentsOfPrincipalInNextTwelveMonths
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearTwo
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearThree
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearsTwoAndThree
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearFour
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearFive
*   LongtermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalInYearsFourAndFive
*   LongTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligationsMaturitiesRepaymentsOfPrincipalAfterYearFive

## Problem solved by the rule
The rule identifies those elements that should no longer be used by the filer.  The taxonomy includes updated elements that reflect the new accounting standards and they should be used. In many cases the filer is unaware that an element has been transitioned and continues to use it until such time as it is deprecated and can no longer be used.  This rule helps identify these elements so that filers can replace the transition elements with elements that reflect current US-GAAP.
