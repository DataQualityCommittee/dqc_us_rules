# Interest Expense Operating and Nonoperating
Rule ID: DQC_0181  
Status: Final  
  
Release date: June 27, 2024  
Effective date: August 31, 2024  
  
## Rule function
These rules apply to the 2024 taxonomy only. The rules are intended to ensure that filers use the correct elements to record interest expense operating and interest expense nonoperating. In the 2024 US-GAAP taxonomy, the FASB added 2 new elements: *InterestExpenseNonoperating* and InterestExpenseOperating. The definition and label changed for the prior element *InterestExpense* (which is used by almost all companies on the face financials)- this is now represents both operating and non-operating.

These rules help ensure that filers  review the usage of the element *InterestExpense*, and replace it with the more specific operating or non-operating element.  

### Component 10180
