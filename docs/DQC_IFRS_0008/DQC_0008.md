# Reversed Calculation
Rule ID: DQC_0008   

## Rule function

This rule evaluates whether a calculation relationship in the company's extension is a reversal of the calculation defined in the base taxonomy used for the filing. The rule checks if the element representing the calculation total and the element representing the component are a reversal of those same elements defined in the base taxonomy with the same calculation weight.  

This rule only compares the defined relationship between two elements joined by a single calculation arc in a company's calculation relationship and checks if the opposite of that relationship exists in the base taxonomy. Both elements in the calculation relationship must have a balance attribute of either debit or credit.  

## Problem solved by the rule

Users expect that the calculation relationships defined between elements in the base taxonomy can be used to identify the meaning of an element. For example when reporting using the IFRS Taxonomy, Mining Assets is a component of Property Plant and Equipment as Property Plant and Equipment  is comprised of Mining Assets, Land Buildings etc.  
 
However, if the company changed the calculation relationship so that Property Plant and Equipment was a component of Mining Assets then a user of the data will have a different meaning of the concept of that reported by the preparer.  

## Example rule message 
(Note: Presentation style of rule messages may differ among software implementations of the rules.)

The calculation in the extension taxonomy rolling up from PropertyPlantAndEquipment to MiningAssets in 00000057 - Disclosure - Segments is the opposite of a calculation defined in the base taxonomy. Check that the calculation is correct or that you have used the correct tag for the two elements identified in the calculation It is possible that the calculation is correct in the case of a reconciliation calculation.

Check that the concept MiningAssets is the correct calculation parent for this element.

### Message template

The calculation in the extension taxonomy rolling up from {$extCalcTargetName} to {$extCalcSourceName} in {$extCalcNetwork} is the opposite of a calculation defined in the base taxonomy. Check that the calculation is correct or that you have used the correct tag for the two elements identified in the calculation It is possible that the calculation is correct in the case of a reconciliation calculation.  

Check that the concept {$extCalcSourceName} is the correct calculation parent for this element.
