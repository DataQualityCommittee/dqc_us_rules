# Reversed Calculation
Rule ID: DQC_0008   
Status: Approved  
Effective date for IFRS filings: June 29, 2018  

## Rule function

This rule evaluates whether a calculation relationship in the company's extension is a reversal of the calculation defined in the base taxonomy used for the filing. The rule checks if the element representing the calculation total and the element representing the component are a reversal of those same elements defined in the base taxonomy with the same calculation weight.  

This rule only compares the defined relationship between two elements joined by a single calculation arc in a company's calculation relationship and checks if the opposite of that relationship exists in the base taxonomy. Both elements in the calculation relationship must have a balance attribute of either debit or credit.  

## Problem solved by the rule

Users expect that the calculation relationships defined between elements in the base taxonomy can be used to identify the meaning of an element. For example when reporting using the US GAAP Taxonomy, Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent is a component of Stockholders Equity Including Portion Attributable To Noncontrolling Interest as Stockholders Equity is comprised of both the portion attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest.  
 
However, if the company changed the calculation relationship so that Stockholders Equity Including Portion Attributable To Noncontrolling Interest was a component of Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent then a user of the data will have a different meaning of the concept of that reported by the preparer.

## Example rule message 
(Note: Presentation style of rule messages may differ among software implementations of the rules.)

The calculation in the extension taxonomy shows Stockholders Equity Including Portion Attributable To Noncontrolling Interest  as a calculation component of  Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent in the network for the balance sheet. This is the opposite of a calculation defined in the base taxonomy. Check that the calculation is correct or that you have used the correct tag for the two elements identified in the calculation. 
  
Rule version: 16.0

### Message template

The calculation in the extension taxonomy shows ${extCalcTargetName} as a calculation component of  ${extCalcSourceName} in the network for the ${networkName}. This is the opposite of a calculation defined in the base US GAAP taxonomy. Check that the calculation is correct or that you have used the correct tag for the two elements identified in the calculation.
