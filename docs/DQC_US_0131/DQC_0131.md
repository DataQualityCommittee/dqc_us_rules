# Lease Allocation in Balance Sheet  
Rule ID: DQC_0131  
Status: Final  
Release date: January 19, 2022
Effective date: May 1, 2022  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies if an extensible list item exists for finance or operating leases. If the filing contains these elements the rule gets the qname representing the balance sheet location  and looks up the value of the BS Item and compares that value to the value of the lease that was reported in the footnotes.

If the value of the lease reported in the footnotes is greater than the balance sheet line item then an error is reported.

## Problem solved by the rule
