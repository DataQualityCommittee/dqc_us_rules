## Rule function
This rule identifies where the filer has reported a fact value for the element RightofuseAssets but the value does not appear on the Statement of financial position and the element PropertyPlantAndEquipment has been included on the Statement of Financial Position.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule detects where filers have reported RightofuseAssets but not included it on the Statements and have used the element PropertyPlantAndEquipment instead of the correct element PropertyPlantAndEquipmentIncludingRightofuseAssets.    

### Example rule message
A value was reported for RightofuseAssets with a value of 123,456,000.  This was not reported on the balance sheet but the element PropertyPlantAndEquipment was reported.  Update the filing to use the element PropertyPlantAndEquipmentIncludingRightofuseAssets instead.

The properties of this RightofuseAssets fact are:
