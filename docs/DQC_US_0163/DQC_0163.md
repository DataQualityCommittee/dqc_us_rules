# Segment Expenditure Addition To Long Lived Assets  
Rule ID: DQC_0163  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 5, 2023  
Effective date: December 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where the filer has used the elements PaymentsToAcquirePropertyPlantAndEquipment or PropertyPlantAndEquipmentAdditions in the segment tables ScheduleOfSegmentReportingInformationBySegmentTable, or ScheduleOfRevenuesFromExternalCustomersAndLongLivedAssetsTable and has not included the element SegmentExpenditureAdditionToLongLivedAssets in the table.

The rule will fire in those cases where values have been defined for PaymentsToAcquirePropertyPlantAndEquipment, PropertyPlantAndEquipmentAdditions. If no values have been reported then the rule will not generate an error.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers use the element SegmentExpenditureAdditionToLongLivedAssets in the segment rather than the cash flow element or PPE additions element. The use of this element is required in FASB guidance and should be used for additions to long lived assets. This disclosure is required under US-GAAP and using the correct element ensures that searches for this data are easier and not ambiguous.    

### Example rule message 
A value of 13,271,083 has been reported for the concept us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentAdditions. This represents additions to PPE and is used in the segment note as a descendant of a segment reporting table us-gaap:ScheduleOfSegmentReportingInformationBySegmentTable.  When reporting addition to long lived assets in the segment disclosure the element SegmentExpenditureAdditionToLongLivedAssets should be used even if the value is the same as the additions to PPE.

Total period: 2021-10-01 to 2022-03-31
