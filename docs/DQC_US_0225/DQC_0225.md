# Prohibited Recognition and Derecognition Items on Income Statement  
Rule ID: DQC.US.0225.10790  
Status: Public Review  
Public Review Release date: TBD  
Effective date: TBD

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC.US.0225.10790 is to ensure that certain recognition and derecognition concepts that represent changes in instant balances (rather than changes in retained earnings) do not appear as line items on the income statement or comprehensive income statement. The rule identifies presentation roles related to income statements and flags any concepts from predefined lists of recognition and derecognition items that should not appear in these statements. These items are more appropriately reported in reconciliation schedules or balance sheet presentations rather than as income statement line items.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all US GAAP filings that include income statement presentation roles containing prohibited recognition or derecognition concepts.
- If a prohibited concept appears in an income statement presentation role, the rule will trigger an error.
- The rule examines presentation roles with descriptions containing "- statement -" and keywords like "income", "operations", or "comprehensive".

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where concepts representing balance sheet changes (such as asset additions, disposals, or equity transactions) are inappropriately presented on the income statement. Such items represent changes in instant balances rather than period-over-period changes in retained earnings and can mislead users about the nature of income statement activities. The rule ensures proper classification and presentation of financial statement elements, improving the clarity and accuracy of financial reporting.

## Example Rule Message

The income statement presentation role [Statement - Consolidated Statements of Operations] includes elements that should not appear on the income statement.

Offending elements: PropertyPlantAndEquipmentAdditions, StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueShareBasedCompensation

These elements represent changes in instant balances and not changes in retained earnings and should be reported in appropriate reconciliations, not as line items on the income statement. Please review the presentation role and remove or relocate the listed elements.
