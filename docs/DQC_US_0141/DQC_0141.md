# Inconsistent Accrued Interest Elements  
Rule ID: DQC_0141  
Status: Final  
Release date: September 21, 2022  
Effective date: December 1, 2022  
  
## Rule function
This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company used the including accrued interest elements and the excluding interest elements in the same context. Companies are required to disclose if they report investments including accrued interest or excluding accrued interest. The FASB has added elements for each policy choice. These elements should be consistently applied.  The rule identifies those facts that include accrued interest and then identifies if there are any facts that exclude accrued interest. If there are elements in both groups then the rule will report an error. The error will identify the largest group of facts and will report an error listing the concepts representing the smallest number of facts.  The rule will run for each year and each dimension and only ensures consistency within that context.

The elements have been identified as those elements including accrued interest and excluding accrued interest.  These have been defined as separate csv files that are read by the rule.  

In some cases filers provide a reconciliation between the amounts excluding accrued interest and the totals including accrued interest.  To avoid getting an error in this case the rule identifies if a calculation relationship has been provided between the amount including accrued interest and the amount excluding accrued interest.  If this calculation is present in the filing an error will not be produced.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule ensures that the correct elements are used in the investment schedule. Specifically it ensures that consistent elements are used for including and excluding accrued interest elements in the investment disclosure.
