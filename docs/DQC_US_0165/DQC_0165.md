Release date: October 5, 2023  
Effective date: December 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where the filer has used the extensible enumeration element PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLifeDescriptionOfTermExtensibleEnumeration with LeaseholdImprovementsMember on the PropertyPlantAndEquipmentByTypeAxis with a value of 'UsefulLifeTermOfLeaseMember'. If the filer has this condition the rule then checks if a filer has also reported a value for the concept PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife using the LeaseholdImprovementsMember. If the element PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLifeDescriptionOfTermExtensibleEnumeration is used with this value then this implies that no value would be provided for the concept PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to support FASB guidance issued for the reporting the useful life of term leases. This rule supports the reporting of the useful life of term leases to ensure that the filing is tagged in compliance with this guidance, specifically that the useful life data is comparable across filings.

If the useful life is the actual term of the lease then the extensible enumeration does not have to be provided.
