# Geographical Axis Used with Pension Line Items
Rule ID: DQC_0068  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 10, 2018  
Effective date: January 1, 2019 

## Rule function 
This rule identifies those cases where the filer has reported the StatementGeographicalAxis in conjunction with a line item in the Compensation Related Costs  and Retirement Benefits section of the taxonomy. The rule identifies those elements (Line Items) defined in the role http://fasb.org/us-gaap/role/disclosure/CompensationRelatedCostsRetirementBenefits that have a value that has also used the StatementGeographicalAxis to define a value.  The rule will flag an error for every fact value that meets this condition.  

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule identifies those cases where filers have reported retirement benefit disclosures using the Statement Geographical axis. This axis should **not** be used for these disclosures. FASB guidance states that plans broken down by geography should use the “Retirement Plan Sponsor Location [Axis]”. Where securities are broken down by location of the securities issuance then the members should be explicitly defined to incorporate the securities location, rather than define a geographical breakdown by axis.  

## Example rule message
The filing has used the StatementGeographicalAxis in conjunction with a line item DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets with a value 345,000  in the Compensation Related Costs  and Retirement Benefits section of the taxonomy. These line items should not use the StatementGeographicalAxis to report a fact. To identify the physical location of the securities a member should be created that indicates both the type of security and its issuance location.  i.e. EquityUSMmember

The properties of this DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets fact are:
