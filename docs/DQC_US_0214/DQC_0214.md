Rule ID: DQC_0214  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0214 is to ensure that key equity related facts disclosed in the financial statements, such as Treasury Stock, Common Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital, Retained Earnings, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Noncontrolling Interest, and Preferred Stock—are also included in the equity section of the balance sheet calculation relationships. This rule validates that if these equity concepts are reported elsewhere in the filing, they also appear in the calculation structure of the balance sheet, ensuring the completeness and consistency of equity disclosures.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all filings that report any of the specified equity concepts in the financial statements. If a filer reports a value for one of these concepts but the concept does not appear in the calculation relationships comprising equity in the balance sheet, the rule will trigger an error.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers disclose important equity facts in the financial statements but omit them from the equity section of the balance sheet calculation relationships. Such omissions can result in incomplete or unclear equity presentations, making it difficult for users to understand the composition of equity. The rule ensures that all key equity facts are properly included in the balance sheet calculations, promoting accurate and transparent reporting.
