## Rule function  
This rule identifies where the filer has reported a fact value which uses the axis InvestmentsByConsolidatedAndNonconsolidatedEntitiesAxis. The rule checks for the existence of any facts that have used this axis and reports an error.  This rule only exists for the 2020 taxonomy.  
  
## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to prevent filers from using this axis, as it has been deprecated in subsequent taxonomies and should not be used on an ongoing basis.
