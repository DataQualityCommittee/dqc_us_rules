# Missing NumberOfReportableSegments When Segment Facts Are Reported  
Rule ID: DQC_0221  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0221 is to ensure that filers report the `NumberOfReportableSegments` element whenever segment facts are disclosed in the filing. Even if a filer only has one segment, the number of reportable segments must be explicitly reported. This rule checks for cases where segment facts are present (using the `StatementBusinessSegmentsAxis`) but the `NumberOfReportableSegments` element is missing, promoting completeness and consistency in XBRL filings.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all filings that report segment facts.  
- If any facts are reported using the `StatementBusinessSegmentsAxis` and the `NumberOfReportableSegments` element is not reported, the rule will trigger an error.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers omit the required disclosure of the number of reportable segments, even though segment information is present in the filing. Omitting this value can lead to incomplete or unclear segment disclosures, making it difficult for users to understand the company's segment structure. The rule ensures that all necessary segment information is included, promoting accurate and complete reporting.

## Example Rule Message

The filing has reported values for segment facts, but has not reported a value for NumberOfReportableSegments. The filer should report a value for NumberOfReportableSegments even if it only has one segment.
