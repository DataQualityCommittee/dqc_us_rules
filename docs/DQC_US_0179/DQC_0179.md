Rule ID: DQC_0179  
Status: Public Exposure March 15 - April 15, 2024 - provide comment at https://xbrl.us/public-review  
Release date: TBD  
Effective date: TBD  
  
## Rule function
These rules apply to the reporting of information related to a specific dividend event. The purpose of the rules is to get consistency of reporting and to support the Dividend guidance released.

The first component of the rule checks that divdend event elements are used with an appropriate axis. In most cases this will be the *DividendsAxis*. The rule checks that the following base axis are not used:
-  *AwardTypeAxis*
-  *srt:TitleOfIndividualAxis*
-  *srt:CurrencyAxis*
-  *srt:RangeAxis*
-  *srt:AwardDateAxis*
-  *StatementEquityComponentsAxis*
-  *FairValueByAssetClassAxis*
-  *RelatedPartyTransactionsByRelatedPartyAxis*
-  *SubsidiarySaleOfStockAxis*
-  *DebtInstrumentAxis*
-  *LongtermDebtTypeAxis*

The rule also checks the following extension elemnts are not used:
- *DividendDeclarationDateAxis*
- *DividendDeclaredAxis*
- *DividendsDeclaredTypeAxis*
- *DistributionsPaymentDateAxis*
  

The second component checks if the dates associated with a dividend event are consecutive. Specifically when dates are reported for the following three concepts the date value of each should be later or the same as the previous date:
- *DividendsPayableDateDeclaredDayMonthAndYear*
- *DividendsPayableDateOfRecordDayMonthAndYear*
- *DividendPayableDateToBePaidDayMonthAndYear*
                            

The third component checks if the value reported for *CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared* has used the correct scale.  It is expected that these amounts will not be rounded to thousands or millions. The rule checks if the inline scale is greater than 0.

The fourth component checks an appropriate period context has been used for the elements *CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared* and *PreferredStockDividendsPerShareDeclared*. It is expected that these elements use a period context that represents a reporting period such as a quarter or a year. The rule identifies all the reporting periods in the instance and excludes any durations that appear less than 5 times in the instance, unless they are q 90 day quarter. If the context dates of the elements *CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared* and *PreferredStockDividendsPerShareDeclared* are in included in the frequencies that occur less than 5 times then an error is reported. This rule picks up those cases where the duration is one day,  or any other period that does not align with the reporting periods in the document.

The fifth component checks where the filer has used the DividendsAxis with a specific member, but has used a concept multiple times on this axis and member with different period contexts.  The DividendAxis should use discrete members to represent different dividend events. The same concept should not be used more than once with the same dividend member. This picks up those cases where the filer has defined members like Quarterly Dividend [Member]

The sixth component checks if the element *DividendsPayableAmountPerShare* has a context date that is later than the payable date of the dividend. The element  *DividendsPayableAmountPerShare* represents the amount of dividends payable at a given date. If the payment date associated with the dividend has passed then there cannot be an amount owed per share.  In these cases the value of the context for *DividendsPayableAmountPerShare* should be changed to the declaration date or the value of *DividendsPayableDateOfRecordDayMonthAndYear* or *DividendsPayableDateToBePaidMonthAndYear* should be changed to reflect the date the dividend will be paid. If the element *DividendsPayableDateToBePaidMonthAndYear* is used it is assumed the payable date is the first of the month.

The seventh component checks if the elements *DividendsPayableDateDeclaredDayMonthAndYear*,*DividendsPayableDateOfRecordDayMonthAndYear*,*DividendPayableDateToBePaidDayMonthAndYear* are used without the DividendsAxis. If they are then an error is reported. When reporting dividend dates in a filing the filer should use the DividendsAxis to associate dividend dates with the related dividend disclosures.

The eight component checks if the DividendMember extension element defined by the filer conforms to the syntax defined in the dividends guidance. This is as follows:
  
- The first character should be either an R or an S to represent a regular or special  dividend.
- The next 4 characters should represent the year that the dividend is applicable. i.e. 2025
- The next one to two characters should represent the period the dividend applies to, such as Q1 for quarterly dividends, H2 for half year dividend or M3 for the 3rd monthly dividend.  Allowable values are either Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, H1, H2, M1, M2, M3 to M13. If it is an annual divided then the character A is required.
- If further disaggregation is needed addition alphabetic can be added after the period such as PreferredA
- The member name must conclude with the string Member.


## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule identifies where the filer has used the DividendsAxis inappropriately in the filing.  

### Example rule message 1

The filing includes a value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:DividendsCommonStock and the retained earnings member with a value of -977,000. Dividends must be deducted from retained earnings.  Please check that the sign of the dividends value is positive.

Dimensions : us-gaap:StatementEquityComponentsAxis=us-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember
Unit : USD

Rule Element Id:10134
Rule version: 24.0.0RC1 

### Example rule message 2

The filing includes a value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:DividendsCommonStock and the the additional paid in capital member with a value of 5,035,000. Dividends should generally be deducted from retained earnings and not deducted from additional paid in capital. In certain cases dividends can be deducted from paid in capital, but in these cases the element AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings defined in the taxonomy should be used.  Please update the filing to reflect this.

### Example rule message 3

The filing includes a negative value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:DividendsCommonStockCash and the the additional paid in capital member with a value of -131,000. If APIC is increasing due to the declaration of dividends this indicates that the filer is doing issuance of stock as a dividend.  This has the impact of increasing APIC and reducing retained earnings. In these cases the elements DividendsCommonStockStock, or DividendsCommonStock should be used.

The properties of this  fact are:

Rule version: 24.0.0RC

### Example rule message 4

The filing includes a value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueStockDividend with a value of 1,706,000. This value represents a dividend paid in stock, but no impact has been reported on the value of APIC. If this is an actual dividend paid in stock it should  include the retained earnings member and not have a value in the default. If it is a dividend paid fully in cash then the element DividendsCommonStockCash should be used.  If it is partial stock and cash then the element DividendsCommonStock should be used.

### Example rule message 5

The filing includes a value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:DividendsCommonStockCash with a value of -1,000. This value is reported with the dimension member CommonStockMember.  This member should not be used with the concept us-gaap:DividendsCommonStockCash.  Please check the filing and select a more appropriate concept.

The filing includes a negative value for dividends using the concept us-gaap:AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings and the the additional paid in capital member with a value of -210,791,000. The element AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings should not be reported with a negative value.  Check the disclosure and determine if the element DividendsCommonStockStock is more appropriate as this element is expected to increase APIC when a dividend distribution is made.
