# Subtotals match Extensible Enumerations in the Schedule of Investments
Rule ID: DQC_0208
Status: Public Review  
Release date: March 31, 2025  
Effective date: July 15, 2025

## Rule Function

**Purpose:** 

The purpose of Rule DQC_0208 is to ensure that any extensible enumeration value reported for the investment type and industry type is properly used as a member on the `InvestmentTypeAxis` and `EquitySecuritiesByIndustryAxis`. This rule validates that the values reported for `InvestmentTypeExtensibleEnumeration` and `InvestmentIndustrySectorExtensibleEnumeration` are consistent with the domain members defined for `InvestmentTypeAxis` and `EquitySecuritiesByIndustryAxis`. If an extensible enumeration value is reported but not used on these axis, it is flagged as a violation. This ensures accurate and consistent tagging of investment types in the Schedule of Investments (SOI) and prevents misclassification or incomplete reporting of investment data.

The rule also checks that if an extensible enumeration value is not directly included on an axis, it verifies whether an ancestor of the member is included in the domain of the axis.

**Conditions:**

The rule will run on all filings that include investment disclosures.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

The problem solved by Rule DQC_0208 is ensuring the consistency and accuracy of reported investment data in the Schedule of Investments (SOI). Specifically, it addresses cases where extensible enumeration values for investment types (e.g., InvestmentTypeExtensibleEnumeration) or industry types (e.g., InvestmentIndustrySectorExtensibleEnumeration) are reported but not properly used as members on their respective axes (InvestmentTypeAxis and EquitySecuritiesByIndustryAxis). This can lead to misclassification, incomplete reporting, or inconsistencies in financial filings. The rule ensures that all reported enumeration values align with the domain members of the axes, maintaining logical and accurate tagging of investment data in financial disclosures.
