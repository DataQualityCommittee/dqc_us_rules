# Plan Asset Categories Percentage
Rule ID: DQC_0072  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 10, 2018  
Effective date: January 1, 2019 

## Rule function 
This rule identifies those cases where the following element have not been tagged with appropriate members. The rule checks that the following element is tagged appropriately based on FASB guidance:

- DefinedBenefitPlanPlanAssetsInvestmentWithinPlanAssetCategoryPercentage

First, this element cannot be tagged without including the Defined Benefit Plan By Plan Asset Categories Axis.  This element must be used in conjunction with the axis DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis. The rule checks that all values using this element have this axis associated with it. If this axis is not defined with values using this element than an error is produced.  

Second, this element  represents a sub component of another plan asset category in the pension disclosure. This element  must be associated with a plan asset category defined using the axis DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis. This means the member used with this element  must be a child member of the member used with the line item DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets. The rule checks any values reported using the line item does not position the Plan Asset category member as a direct child of DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis.  

The components of the rule work across all additional dimensions used in the disclosure. For example these rules are applied for every pension plan that is disclosed by the company.  

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule follows the guidance issued by the FASB in the [Implementation Guide Retirement Benefits &#8211; Phase 2](https://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Document_C&#038;cid=1176169401814&#038;d=&#038;pagename=FASB%2FDocument_C%2FDocumentPage). 

The rule specifically addresses the Guidance associated with examples 3 and 4a.
