# Plan Asset Categories Component Members
Rule ID: DQC_0069  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 10, 2018  
Effective date: January 1, 2019 

## Rule function 
This rule identifies those cases where the following elements have not been tagged with appropriate members and values. The rule checks that the following two elements are tagged appropriately based on FASB guidance :

- DefinedBenefitPlanPlanAssetsInvestmentWithinPlanAssetCategoryAmount

  - Abbreviated as Inv_In_Cat

- DefinedBenefitPlanAmountOfEmployerAndRelatedPartySecuritiesIncludedInPlanAssets

  - Abbreviated as Rel_Party

First, these two elements cannot be tagged without including the Defined Benefit Plan By Plan Asset Categories Axis.  These two elements must be used in conjunction with the axis DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis. The rule checks that all values using these elements have this axis associated with them. If this axis is not defined with values using these elements then an error is produced.  

Second, these elements represent a sub component of another plan asset category in the pension disclosure. These elements must be associated with a plan asset category defined using the axis DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis. This means the member used with these elements must be a child member of the member used with the line item DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets. The rule checks any values reported using the line items do not position the Plan Asset category member as a direct child of DefinedBenefitPlanByPlanAssetCategoriesAxis .  

Third, the rule checks that any values reported for the elements Inv_In_Cat and Rel_Party do not have a value that is greater than or equal to the value reported for DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets. The rule matches the values where the members of Inv_In_Cat and Rel_Party are children of the member used to report the values for DefinedBenefitPlanFairValueOfPlanAssets.  

The three components of the rule work across all additional dimensions used in the disclosure. For example these rules are applied for every pension plan that is disclosed by the company.  

## Problem solved by the rule
This rule follows the guidance issued by the FASB in the [Implementation Guide Retirement Benefits &#8211; Phase 2](https://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Document_C&#038;cid=1176169401814&#038;d=&#038;pagename=FASB%2FDocument_C%2FDocumentPage). 

The rule specifically addresses the Guidance associated with examples 3 and 4a.
