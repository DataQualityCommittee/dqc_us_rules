Rule ID: DQC_0098  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 7, 2020  
Effective date: January 1, 2021  
  
## Rule function  
This rule identifies where the element ContractWithCustomerLiabilityRevenueRecognized (Contract with Customer, Liability, Revenue Recognized) is greater than the value of ContractWithCustomerLiability reported in the instance. The Value of "Contract with Customer, Liability, Revenue Recognized" should be less than or equal to:  
  
*   Prior period-end value of "Contract with Customer, Liability" or  
*   Sum of prior period-end values of "Contract with Customer, Liability, Current" and "Contract with Customer, Liability, Noncurrent."  
  
The rule compares the value of the opening balance of the liability to ensure that it is greater than or equal to the value recognized as revenue during the period.  
  
The rule is separated into two components. The first checks for the following fail case:  
  
```  
"Contract with Customer, Liability, Revenue Recognized" >  "Contract with Customer, Liability"  
```  
  
The second checks that:  
  
```  
"Contract with Customer, Liability, Revenue Recognized" > ( "Contract with Customer, Liability, Current" + "Contract with Customer, Liability, Noncurrent.")  
```  
  
## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to prevent the unintended use of the element "Contract with Customer, Liability, Revenue Recognized".  This rule is intended to facilitate the appropriate and consistent use of the element and to enhance quality and accuracy of XBRL data and its critical financial information required by the standard. The value of revenue recognized should be  the amount of revenue recognized that was previously included in the balance of the obligation to transfer goods or services to the customer for which consideration from the customer has been received or is due.
