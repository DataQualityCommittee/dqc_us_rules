# OCI Items In Income  
Rule ID: DQC_0148  
Status: Final  
Release date: January 25, 2023  
Effective date: March 31, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule checks if OCI items have been included in the calculation of net income.  The rule identifies the components of Net Income by getting the calculation descendants of either NetIncomeLoss, ProfitLoss, NetIncomeLossAvailableToCommonStockholdersBasic or NetIncomeLossAvailableToCommonStockholdersDiluted and determining that none of these descendants are an OCI item. OCI items are determined by taking the elements in the calculation extended link roles of the US GAAP taxonomy for other comprehensive income.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers do not use OCI elements as a component of net income. This helps to prevent filers from selecting an incorrect element. 

### Example rule message
The company has reported the concept us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossAvailableForSaleSecuritiesTax as a descendant of Income Loss in the calculation linkbase of the filing.  This element is an OCI item and should not be included as a component of Net Income Loss.  

Rule Element ID: 9872  
Rule version: 20.0.0
