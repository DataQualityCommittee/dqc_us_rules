# OCI Items In Income & Income in OCI 
Rule ID: DQC_0148  
Status: Final  
Release date: July 6, 2023  
Effective date: September 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule checks if OCI items have been included in the calculation of net income.  The rule identifies the components of Net Income by reviewing the calculation descendants of either NetIncomeLoss, ProfitLoss, NetIncomeLossAvailableToCommonStockholdersBasic or NetIncomeLossAvailableToCommonStockholdersDiluted and determining that none of these descendants are an OCI item. OCI items are determined by taking the elements in the calculation extended link roles of the US GAAP taxonomy for other comprehensive income.

The rule also identifies where income items are included in the calculation of OCI.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers do not use OCI elements as a component of net income and vice versa. This helps to prevent filers from selecting an incorrect element. 

### Example rule message 1
