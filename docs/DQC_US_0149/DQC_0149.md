# Use of Noncurrent Assets  
Rule ID: DQC_0149  
Status: Final  
Release date: July 6, 2023  
Effective date: September 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule checks if the Noncurrent Assets element has been used appropriately. This element represents long lived assets that are reported as part of the geographical segment. A number of filers have been using this element to represent Assets Noncurrent that appears on the balance sheet.   The first component of this rule checks that this element does not appear in the presentation linkbase representing the balance sheet. 

The second component of the rule checks that the element appears as a presentation descendant of the hypercube element ScheduleOfRevenuesFromExternalCustomersAndLongLivedAssetsTable.  The  rule flags an error if a different hypercube is an ancestor of the Noncurrent Asset element.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule is intended to ensure that filers use the NoncurrentAssets element appropriately as a measure of long lived assets across geographies. 

### Example rule message 1
The element NoncurrentAssets should not appear in the face financial statements of a filing. This element represents long lived assets that are reported in the segment reporting section of the financial statements. Use the element AssetsNoncurrent on the Balance Sheet.
