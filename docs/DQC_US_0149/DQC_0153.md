# Financial Statements Table Placement  
Rule ID: DQC_0153  
Status: Public Exposure  
Release date: TBD  
Effective date: TBD  
  
## Rule function
This rule checks the financial statement disclosures for a hypercube that is not contain all primary items in the disclosure.  The rule looks for monetary items that are siblings to the table in the financial statements. Any monetary items not included as primary items of the cube are reported as errors.

## Problem solved by the rule  
In a limited number of cases filers are reporting tables in the body of the financial statements to report dimensionalized values. This means that the primary items reported in the financial statement are are not included in the table.  Users of the data expect the statement table to include the contents of the statement. This practice also means a filer could report multiple tables in a financial statement making it difficult to analyze. 

The rule also ensures consistency of filings.   

### Example rule message 
The hypercube us-gaap:StatementTable should not appear in the statement 0000003 - Statement - Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income with the monetary sibling concepts of us-gaap:IncomeLossFromContinuingOperationsBeforeIncomeTaxesExtraordinaryItemsNoncontrollingInterest, us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit, us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossNetOfTax, us-gaap:ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax, us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss. The hypercube should be a child of an abstract concept and should have the primary monetary concepts as decendants.

## For Developers  
The [Global Rule Logic document](https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/master/docs/GlobalRuleLogic.md) contains general guidelines for implementation of rules. The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter's value is to occur. 

### General message template  
The filer has reported a value of {$invalidItem}  using the extension concept {$invalidItem.concept.name}. This value should be tagged with separate  US GAAP elements for the Basic amount and the diluted amount.  This means the same fact needs to be tagged with separate elements.  An extension element should not be used to tag this fact.

The properties of this {$invalidItem.concept.name} fact are:

Period: {$invalidItem.period}
Dimensions: {$invalidItem.dimensions.join(', ','=')}
Unit: {$invalidItem.unit}

Rule Element ID: {$ruleId}
Rule version: {$ruleVersion}

### Rule element ID index
