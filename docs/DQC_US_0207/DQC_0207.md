# Invalid Subtotals in Schedule of Investments
Rule ID: DQC_0207  
Status: Final  
Release date: June 18, 2025  
Effective date: September 1, 2025

## Rule Function

**Purpose:** 

The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the fair value of investments reported for broader categories (e.g., by industry, geography, or security type) is greater than or equal to the fair value reported for more specific categories that include additional dimensions. This rule checks for consistency in the reporting of Business Development Company (BDC) subtotals to prevent errors caused by incorrect use of dimensions. Specifically, it ensures that the aggregate value for a broader category (e.g., EquitySecuritiesByIndustryAxis) is not less than the value reported for subsets of that category with additional dimensions.  The rule checks the following dimensions:

* EquitySecuritiesByIndustryAxis
* InvestmentTypeAxis
* InvestmentIssuerAffiliationAxis
* InvestmentIssuerNameAxis
* StatementGeographicalAxis

**Conditions:**

The rule will run on all filings that include investment disclosures.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

The problem solved by this rule is ensuring the consistency and accuracy of reported Business Development Company (BDC) investment subtotals in financial filings.  This issue can arise from misreporting or incorrect use of dimensions, leading to inconsistencies in the reported data. The rule ensures that the aggregate value for a broader category is greater than or equal to the value reported for subsets with more specific dimensions, maintaining logical and accurate financial reporting.
