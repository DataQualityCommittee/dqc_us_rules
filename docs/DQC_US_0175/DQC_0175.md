# Litigation Settlement Roll Forward Elements  
Rule ID: DQC_0175  
Status: Final  
Release date: January 16, 2024  
Effective date: May 16, 2024  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where the LitigationSettlementAmountAwardedFromOtherParty or LitigationSettlementAmountAwardedToOtherParty concepts role up into an income statement account. These concepts represent changes in the balance of litigation receivable and payable and do not represent the gain or loss from settlement. In these cases use the elements LitigationSettlementGain or LitigationSettlementLoss should be used.


## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule identifies where the filer has used an incorrect element in their filing. This mis identification of the element can occur because the nature of the account roll forward element is similar to a gain or loss element that would appear in the income statement.

### Example rule message 
The concept(s) LitigationSettlementAmountAwardedFromOtherParty, LitigationSettlementAmountAwardedToOtherParty has been reported as a calculation descendant of the concept(s) ProfitLoss.  These concepts represent change in the balance of litigation receivable and payable and are not the gain or loss from settlement. In these cases use the elements LitigationSettlementGain or LitigationSettlementLoss.

Rule Element ID: 10130
