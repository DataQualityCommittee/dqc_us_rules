# Dividend Disclosures in the Components of Equity (IFRS) 
Rule ID: DQC_0186   
Status: Final  
  
Release date: June 27, 2024  
Effective date: August 31, 2024  
  
## Rule function
This rule applies to dividend disclosures reported in the Statement of Changes in Equity using the *ComponentsOfEquityAxis*. The rule is comprised of nithreene components that are designed to determine that the filer has selected the correct elements in the Statement of Changes in Equity. 

The first component of the rule checks that dividend elements used with the retained earnings member are reported with a positive value.  The impact on retained earnings should reduce the retained earnings balance.  Because these a debit balances the values should be positive.

The second component checks if dividend line items have been used with the appropriate members of the components of equity axis. The rule identifies inappropriate members used  with the *ComponentsOfEquityAxis* and dividend line items.  The following members should not be used with dividend line items:
|Member| Dividend  Line Items |
|--- |--- |
|TreasurySharesMember | All dividend line items|
|AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeMember | All dividend line items|
|ReserveOfSharebasedPaymentsMember|All dividend line items|
|OtherReservesMember|All dividend line items|

The third component if a dividend line item has been used with a redundant class of stock axis. This identifies where a member should not be used with a dividend concept as the type of stock declared is already communicated with the concept name, and the dimensions provides no additional disaggregation. This rule checks the concepts *DividendsPaidOrdinarySharesPerShare* and *DividendsPaidOtherSharesPerShare*.
