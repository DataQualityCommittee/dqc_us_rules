# Missing InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration on the Schedule of Investments  
Rule ID: DQC_0218  
Status: Public Exposure December 8, 2025 - January 22, 2026 - provide comment at https://xbrl.us/public-review  
Public Review Release date: December 8, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0218 is to ensure that the required extensible enumeration element, `InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration`, is properly reported in the Schedule of Investments (SOI). This rule validates that for each investment disclosed on the `InvestmentIdentifierAxis` with a value for `InvestmentOwnedAtCost`, the corresponding `InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration` value is also reported. By enforcing the inclusion of this element, the rule ensures accurate, complete, and consistent tagging of investment data, preventing omissions that could lead to incomplete or unclear financial disclosures.

**Conditions:**

The rule will run on all filings that include schedule of investment disclosures.  
- For each member of the `InvestmentIdentifierAxis` where a value for `InvestmentOwnedAtCost` is reported, the rule checks that a value for `InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration` is also reported in the same context (i.e., same axis member and unit).
- If `InvestmentOwnedAtCost` is reported but `InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration` is missing for that investment, the rule will trigger an error.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers report investments on the Schedule of Investments but omit the required extensible enumeration value that identifies the issuer affiliation for each investment. Omitting this value can lead to incomplete, unclear, or inconsistent financial disclosures, making it difficult for users of the financial statements to fully understand the nature and classification of the investments. The rule ensures that all necessary extensible enumeration elements are included, promoting accurate and complete tagging of investment data.

## Example Rule Message

"The filer has reported a schedule of investments and has provided a value of 17,105,928  for the InvestmentOwnedAtCost concept.  This is for the investment Mad View Place, LLC.  The filer has not reported a value for the InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration concept on this axis.  The values reported for the InvestmentIssuerAffiliationExtensibleEnumeration concept should be reported to identify the issuer affiliation that this investment has.  Please ensure that these values are reported for each investment on the InvestmentIdentifierAxis.
