# IFRS Non Positive Items  
Rule ID: DQC_0092  
Status: Final  
Release date: July 15, 2020  
Effective date: September 1, 2020  

## Rule function
This rule identifies where filers have used a positive value for an item that should be negative.  The rule consists of two sub components. The first checks that values using the EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember have a negative value. The second checks that certain elements used with the Carrying Amount Accumulated Depreciation Amortisation And Impairment And Gross Carrying Amount Axis and Accumulated depreciation members always have a negative value.

**Part 1.**
The first rule takes the list of non negative items used in rule DQC.IFRS.0080 and checks that any values reported for these elements and the SegmentConsolidationItemsAxis = EliminationOfIntersegmentAmountsMember is always a negative number.  It excludes those facts that have additional dimensions and members that are known to flip the sign of a value.  This list of axis members and axis member combinations is the same list that is used for the non neg rule DQC.IFRS.0080.

**Part 2.**
The second rule takes a list of asset related elements and checks that any values reported for these elements and the axis  CarryingAmountAccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentAndGrossCarryingAmountAxis used with any of the following members is always negative:

  1. AccumulatedImpairmentMember
  1. AccumulatedDepreciationAmortisationAndImpairmentMember
  1. AccumulatedDepreciationAndAmortisationMember

This rule also excludes those facts that have additional dimensions and members that are known to flip the sign of a value.  This list of axis members and axis member combinations is the same list that is used for the non neg rule DQC.IFRS.0080.

## Problem solved by the rule
The intent of the rule is to identify those facts that have been entered with a positive value when the value in fact should have been a negative amount.

## Example rule message

## For Developers
The [Global Rule Logic document](https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/master/docs/GlobalRuleLogic.md) contains general guidelines for implementation of rules. The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter's value is to occur.
