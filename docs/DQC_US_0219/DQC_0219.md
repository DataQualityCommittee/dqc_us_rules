Rule ID: DQC_0219  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 15, 2025  
Effective date: December 15, 2025  

## Rule Function

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0219 is to ensure that filers report a value for the element `NonInvestmentAssetsLessNonInvestmentLiabilities` when certain conditions are met in the filing. Specifically, if the filer has reported both `AssetsNet` and `InvestmentOwnedAtFairValue` in the same context, and `AssetsNet` has a calculation child of `InvestmentOwnedAtFairValue` as well as an extension item with a negative value, then the filer should also report a value for `NonInvestmentAssetsLessNonInvestmentLiabilities`. This rule helps ensure that the financial statement presentation is complete and that key calculated values are not omitted.

**Conditions:**

The rule applies to all filings that do not report a value for `NonInvestmentAssetsLessNonInvestmentLiabilities`.  
- If both `AssetsNet` and `InvestmentOwnedAtFairValue` are reported in the same context,
- And `AssetsNet` has a calculation child of `InvestmentOwnedAtFairValue` and an extension item with a negative value,
- Then a value for `NonInvestmentAssetsLessNonInvestmentLiabilities` must be reported.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule addresses cases where filers omit the value for `NonInvestmentAssetsLessNonInvestmentLiabilities` even though the calculation structure and reported facts indicate that it should be present. Omitting this value can lead to incomplete or unclear financial disclosures, making it difficult for users to fully understand the composition of net assets and liabilities. The rule ensures that all necessary calculated values are included, promoting accurate and complete tagging of financial data.

## Example Rule Message
