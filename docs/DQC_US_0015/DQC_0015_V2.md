# Negative Values - Additions to Existing Rule DQC_0015
##Rule Function
The US GAAP Taxonomy is designed so that the majority of elements have a positive value. This rule tests whether the values for a given list of elements are negative. The rule does not test elements when a specified member is present which would allow the value to be negative.

[This rule was approved by the Committee](DQC_0015.md) on November 18, 2015 - **below are additions to the initial release onÂ which the Committee is requesting comment**.

## Additional Non-negative Elements

> See file [DQC_0015 List of Elements V2](DQC_0015_ListOfElementsV2.xlsx?raw=true) which provides a list of additional elements that should not be negative. The rule tests whether these elements have a negative value in an XBRL document. The elements are listed in order of most commonly occurring errors.
