# Incorrect Calculation of Lease Liability Payments Due  
Rule ID: DQC_0090  
Status: Final  
Release date: February 12, 2020  
Effective date: May 15, 2020  

## Rule function  
This rule identifies 10-K, 10-K/A and 20-F filings where the concept  FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue is not equal to the sum of FinanceLeaseLiability and FinanceLeaseLiabilityUndiscountedExcessAmount.  

The rule will run when the addend appears in the filing.  

## Problem solved by the rule  
The intent of the rule is to allow filers to check that their filing is consistent with the  FASB's XBRL implementation  guide.  This rule addresses those cases where the filer has used an inappropriate addend in the calculation of lease liability payments, and can identify where an inappropriate element is used to identify the undiscounted amount.  

## Example rule message  
The element FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue with a value of 100,000 should be equal to the sum of FinanceLeaseLiability plus FinanceLeaseLiabilityUndiscountedExcessAmount. The value of these adds to 43,000.  A difference of 57,000. In an annual filing this reconciliation is required and all elements should have a value in the current reporting period.  

Period: 2019-01 -01 to 2019-12-31  
Dimensions: none  
Decimals: -6  

Rule Element ID: 9372  
Rule version: 11.0
