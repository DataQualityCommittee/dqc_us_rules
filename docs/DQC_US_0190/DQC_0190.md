Rule ID: DQC_0190  
Status: Final  
Release date: September 25, 2024  
Effective date: November 30, 2024  
  
## Rule Function
This rule contains a number of checks to ensure that the form 11-K (EBP) is completed in compliance with the FASB implementation guide.  The rule checks for the following
  
*   The first check (10600) ensures that non EBP filings such as a s a 10-K or 10-Q do not use concepts defined in the EBP taxonomy.
*   The second check (10601) determines if the filer has used the concepts EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue or EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue has been used in the hypercube ‘Employee Benefit Plan, Master Trust \[Table\]’. This concept should not be used in this table and should be replaced with EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue.
*   The third check (10602) looks at each of the following hypercubes:
    
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValueAndNavTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanNonparticipantDirectedInvestmentTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanRelatedPartyAndPartyInInterestTransactionsTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanScheduleOfAllocationAssetAndLiabilityTable
    
    The rule then determines if the concept EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue has been used to report a fact in the hypercube. If it has and the concepts us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue or us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue have not been used to report a fact value in the same hypercube, then an error message is produced
    
*   The fourth check (10603) looks at each of the following hypercubes:
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValueAndNavTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanNonparticipantDirectedInvestmentTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanRelatedPartyAndPartyInInterestTransactionsTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanScheduleOfAllocationAssetAndLiabilityTable  
        The rule then determines if the concept EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentContractValue has been used to report a fact in the hypercube. If it has and the concepts us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue or us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue have not been used to report a fact value in the same hypercube, then an error message is produced
*   The fifth check (10604) looks at each of the following hypercubes:
    
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable,
    *   us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfChangeInNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable
    
    The rule then determines the axis EmployeeBenefitPlanNonconsolidatedMasterTrustAndPlanInterestInMasterTrustAxis has been used on the hypercube to report a fact. If it has an error is produced, as this axis should not be added to these 2 hypercubes.
    
*   The sixth check (10605) determines if the filer has reported a value for for the concept EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue in the filing, and has not reported a value for either EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue or EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue. One of these values should be reported if EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue is reported.
*   The seventh check (10606) determines if the filer has reported a value for the concept EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairAndContractValue in the filing, and has not reported a value for either EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue or EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentContractValue. One of these values should be reported if EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairAndContractValue is reported.
*   The eighth check (10607) determines if the filer has reported a fact value using any of the following concepts:
    
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue,
    *   EmployeeBenefitPlanChangeInNetAssetAvailableForBenefitIncreaseDecreaseForChangeInPlanInterestInMasterTrust
    
    with the axis EmployeeBenefitPlanNonconsolidatedMasterTrustAndPlanInterestInMasterTrustAxis. If they have then an error message is produced.
    
*   The ninth check (10612) determines if the filer has reported a value for a concept in the filing using the InvestmentIdentifierAxis and one or more additional axis. When using the InvestmentIdentifierAxis with a fact the only additional axis allowed is the LegalEntityAxis.
*   The tenth check (10613) determines if the filer has reported a value for a concept in the filing, with the axis EmployeeBenefitPlanAllocationStatusAxis and memberEmployeeBenefitPlanUnallocatedMember and the axis EmployeeBenefitPlanParticipantDirectedStatusAxis with the member EmployeeBenefitPlanParticipantDirectedMember. These two axis should not be used together on a fact with these members. See FASB EBP guidance example 6a/Note 2b.
*   The eleventh check (10616) determines if all facts reported in the instance include the LegalEntityAxis.
*   The twelfth check (10617) determines if all members on the LegalEntityAxis are in the format EBP11-1111111-011Member.
   
## Problem Solved by the Rule
The rule is intended to ensure that the filing follows the implementation guidance defined by the FASB for filing the form 11-K.

## For Developers
The [Global Rule Logic](https://xbrl.us/dqc_0001) document contains general guidelines for implementation of rules.

The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter’s value is to occur.
