Rule ID: DQC_0190  
Status: Final  
Release date: September 25, 2024  
Effective date: November 30, 2024  
  
## Rule Function
This rule contains a number of checks to ensure that the form 11-K (EBP) is completed in compliance with the FASB implementation guide.  The rule checks for the following
  
- **The first check (10600)** ensures that non EBP filings such as a s a 10-K or 10-Q do not use concepts defined in the EBP taxonomy.
- **The second check (10601)** determines if the filer has used the concepts `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue` or `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue` has been used in the hypercube 'Employee Benefit Plan, Master Trust \[Table\]'. This concept should not be used in this table and should be replaced with `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue`.
- **The third check (10602)** looks at each of the following hypercubes:    
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValueAndNavTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanNonparticipantDirectedInvestmentTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanRelatedPartyAndPartyInInterestTransactionsTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanScheduleOfAllocationAssetAndLiabilityTable`
  The rule then determines if the concept `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue` has been used to report a fact in the hypercube. If it has and the concepts `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue` or `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue` have not been used to report a fact value in the same hypercube, then an error message is produced    
- **The fourth check (10603)** looks at each of the following hypercubes:
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValueAndNavTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanNonparticipantDirectedInvestmentTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanRelatedPartyAndPartyInInterestTransactionsTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanScheduleOfAllocationAssetAndLiabilityTable`  
  The rule then determines if the concept EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentContractValue has been used to report a fact in the hypercube. If it has and the concepts `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue` or `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue` have not been used to report a fact value in the same hypercube, then an error message is produced
- **The fifth check (10604)** looks at each of the following hypercubes:  
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable`,
  * `us-gaap-ebp:EmployeeBenefitPlanStatementOfChangeInNetAssetAvailableForBenefitTable`
  The rule then determines the axis `EmployeeBenefitPlanNonconsolidatedMasterTrustAndPlanInterestInMasterTrustAxis` has been used on the hypercube to report a fact. If it has an error is produced, as this axis should not be added to these 2 hypercubes.    
- **The sixth check (10605)** determines if the filer has reported a value for for the concept `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue` in the filing, and has not reported a value for either `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue` or `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue. One of these values should be reported if EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue` is reported.
- **The seventh check (10606)** determines if the filer has reported a value for the concept `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairAndContractValue` in the filing, and has not reported a value for either `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairValue` or `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentContractValue`. One of these values should be reported if `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentFairAndContractValue` is reported.
- **The eighth check (10607)** determines if the filer has reported a fact value using any of the following concepts:   
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustContractValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanInvestmentExcludingPlanInterestInMasterTrustFairAndContractValue`,
  * `EmployeeBenefitPlanChangeInNetAssetAvailableForBenefitIncreaseDecreaseForChangeInPlanInterestInMasterTrust` 
  with the axis `EmployeeBenefitPlanNonconsolidatedMasterTrustAndPlanInterestInMasterTrustAxis`. If they have then an error message is produced.
- **The ninth check (10612)** determines if the filer has reported a value for a concept in the filing using the `InvestmentIdentifierAxis` and one or more additional axis. When using the `InvestmentIdentifierAxis` with a fact the only additional axis allowed is the `LegalEntityAxis`.
- **The tenth check (10613)** determines if the filer has reported a value for a concept in the filing, with the axis `EmployeeBenefitPlanAllocationStatusAxis` and member `EmployeeBenefitPlanUnallocatedMember` and the axis `EmployeeBenefitPlanParticipantDirectedStatusAxis` with the member `EmployeeBenefitPlanParticipantDirectedMember`. These two axis should not be used together on a fact with these members. See FASB EBP guidance example 6a/Note 2b.
- **The eleventh check (10616)** determines if all facts reported in the instance include the `LegalEntityAxis`.
- **The twelfth check (10617)** determines if all members on the `LegalEntityAxis` are in the format EBP11-1111111-011Member.
   
## Problem Solved by the Rule
The rule is intended to ensure that the filing follows the implementation guidance defined by the FASB for filing the form 11-K.

## For Developers
The [Global Rule Logic document](https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/master/docs/GlobalRuleLogic.md) document contains general guidelines for implementation of rules.

The rule message template contains text and parametric reference to arguments of the rule operation, using the syntax ${parameter} to indicate that insertion of a parameter’s value is to occur.
