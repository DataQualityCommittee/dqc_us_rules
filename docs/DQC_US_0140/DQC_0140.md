# Investment Schedule Cross Calc  
Rule ID: DQC_0140  
Status: Final  
Release date: September 21, 2022  
Effective date: December 1, 2022  
  
## Rule function
This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company has misused elements in the investment schedule showing the difference in amortized cost and fair value. The rule checks that the investment schedule that shows the difference between amortized cost and fair value is calculated correctly. This rule has two components.

The rule takes the components and calculates each line as a separate iteration, for each dimension member. The rule operates once for amounts including accrued interest and once for amounts excluding accrued interest.   Both rules should not fire for the same filing as filers are required to report either the values including accrued interest or excluding accrued interest.  The fair value and amortized cost concepts must be present for the rule to fire.

#### Component 1
Identifies the investment schedule rows are calculated correctly where the company includes accrued interest in the reported value for investments.

This component checks that amortized cost less any credit losses and accumulated gains and losses is equal to the fair value of the investment. The rule will operate on any dimensions used. The calculation is defined as follows:

```AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostNoncurrent)
MINUS 
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAllowanceForCreditLoss or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAllowanceForCreditLossCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAllowanceForCreditLossNoncurrent)
PLUS
AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAccumulatedGrossUnrealizedGainBeforeTax
MINUS
AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAccumulatedGrossUnrealizedLossBeforeTax
EQUALS
AvailableForSaleSecuritiesDebtSecurities or  
(AvailableForSaleSecuritiesDebtSecuritiesCurrent +  
AvailableForSaleSecuritiesDebtSecuritiesNoncurrent)
```

If the amortized cost value before credit loss is not reported then the following elements are used:
```
 DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAfterAllowanceForCreditLoss or  
 (DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAfterAllowanceForCreditLossCurrent +  
 DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAfterAllowanceForCreditLossNoncurrent)
```

#### Component 2
Identifies the investment schedule rows are calculated correctly where the company excludes accrued interest in the reported value for investments.

This component checks that amortized cost less any credit losses and accumulated gains and losses is equal to the fair value of the investment. The rule will operate on any dimensions used.

The calculation is defined as follows:

```
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostExcludingAccruedInterestBeforeAllowanceForCreditLoss or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostExcludingAccruedInterestBeforeAllowanceForCreditLossCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostExcludingAccruedInterestBeforeAllowanceForCreditLossNoncurrent)
MINUS 
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterest or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterestCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterestNoncurrent)
PLUS
AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAccumulatedGrossUnrealizedGainBeforeTax
MINUS
AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAccumulatedGrossUnrealizedLossBeforeTax
EQUALS
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleExcludingAccruedInterest or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleExcludingAccruedInterestCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleExcludingAccruedInterestNoncurrent)
```

If the amortized cost value before credit loss is not reported then the following elements are used:

```
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterest or  
(DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterestCurrent +  
DebtSecuritiesAvailableForSaleAmortizedCostAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterestNoncurrent)
```

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule ensures that the correct elements are used in the investment schedule. Specifically it ensures that consistent elements are used for including and excluding accrued interest elements in the investment disclosure. If the company has a credit loss a consistent XBRL calculation cannot always be defined.  This rule helps to ensure that this calculation can be checked reliably if no calculation linkbase is defined.
