# Dividend Disclosures in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity  
Rule ID: DQC_0178  
Status: Committee review for public exposure  
Release date: TBD  
Effective date: TBD  
  
## Rule function
This rule applies to dividend disclosures reported in the Statement of Changes in Equity using the *StatementEquityComponentsAxis*. The rule is comprised of nine components that are designed to determine that the filer has selected the correct elements in the Statement of Changes in Equity. 

The first component of the rule checks that dividend elements used with the retained earnings member are reported with a positive value.  The impact on retained earnings should reduce the retained earnings balance.  Because these a debit balances the values should be positive.

The second component checks if the filer has reported dividends  against APIC and if the value is positive.   Dividends should generally be deducted from retained earnings and not deducted from additional paid in capital. In certain cases dividends can be deducted from paid in capital, but in these cases the element *AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings* defined in the taxonomy should be used. 

The third component checks if dividends paid in cash cause the value of APIC to increase. If APIC is increasing due to the declaration of dividends this indicates that the filer is issuing a stock as a dividend.  This has the impact of increasing APIC and reducing retained earnings. In these cases the elements *DividendsCommonStockStock*, or *DividendsCommonStock* should be used, rather than using the Cash Dividend element of *DividendsCommonStockCash* and *DividendsPreferredStockCash*.

The fourth component checks if the filing includes a value for dividends using the concepts *DividendsCommonStockStock* or *StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueStockDividend* with a value using the retained earnings member that is the same as the default value, and no value reported using the APIC member. These elements represent a dividend paid in stock, but no impact has been reported on the value of APIC. If this is an actual dividend paid in stock it should  include the retained earnings member and not have a value in the default. If it is a dividend paid fully in cash then the element *DividendsCommonStockCash* should be used.  If it is partial stock and cash then the element *DividendsCommonStock* should be used.

The fifth component checks if dividend line items have been used with the appropriate members of the components of equity axis. The rule identifies inappropriate members used  with the *StatementEquityComponentsAxis* and dividend line items.  The following members should not be used with dividend line items:
|Member| Dividend  Line Items |
|--- |--- |
|RetainedEarningsAppropriatedMember | All dividend line items|
|CommonStockMember | DividendsPreferredStockCash, DividendsPreferredStock, DividendsPreferredStockStock, DividendsPreferredStockPaidinkind, DividendsCash, DividendsCommonStockCash|
|CommonStockIncludingAdditionalPaidInCapitalMember|DividendsPreferredStockCash, DividendsPreferredStock, DividendsPreferredStockStock, DividendsPreferredStockPaidinkind|
|PreferredStockMember|DividendsCommonStock, DividendsCommonStockStock, DividendsCommonStockCash, DividendsCommonStock, DividendsCommonStockPaidinkind, DividendsPreferredStockCash, DividendsCash|
|PreferredStockIncludingAdditionalPaidInCapitalMember|DividendsCommonStock, DividendsCommonStockStock, DividendsCommonStockCash, DividendsCommonStock, DividendsCommonStockPaidinkind|
|TreasuryStockPreferredMember|  All dividend line items|
|TreasuryStockCommonMember|  All dividend line items|
|AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeMember|  All dividend line items|
|ComprehensiveIncomeMember|  All dividend line items|

The sixth component checks if a negative value has been reported for the element *AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings* when it is used with the retained earnings member.

The seventh component checks if checks if a negative value has been reported for the element *AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalDividendsInExcessOfRetainedEarnings* when it is used with no member on the equity components axis.

The eight component if a dividend line item has been used with a redundant class of stock axis. This identifies where a member should not be used with a dividend concept as the type of stock declared is already communicated with the concept name, and the dimensions provides no additional disaggregation. This rule checks the concepts *CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared* and *PreferredStockDividendsPerShareDeclared*.

The ninth component checks if The filing includes a  value for the concepts *StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueDividendReinvestmentPlan* or *StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueStockDividend* using the *RetainedEarningsMember* that is positive. These elements are a credit elements so, the value must be entered as a negative amount to reduce retained earnings.

## Problem solved by the rule
