# Negative Values
 
## Rule description 
The IFRS Taxonomy is designed so that the majority of elements have a positive value. This rule tests whether the values for a given list of elements are negative. The rule does not test elements when a specified member is present which would allow the value to be negative.  

See file [DQC_0080_ListOfElements.xlsx](DQC_0080_ListOfElements.xlsx?raw=true) which provides a list of elements that should not be negative. The rule tests whether these elements have a negative value in an XBRL document.  

See file [DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx](DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx?raw=true) for a list of members that, when used with these elements, allow the value of the element to be negative. The rule does not test these member/element combinations.  

## Authoritative reference
The IFRS taxonomy is designed for the majority of elements to have a positive value, so that the value reported in the XBRL document represents the correct balance type for the element (e.g., debit balance type for assets and expenses and losses or credit balance type for liabilities and income and gains). If the value reported in the HTML document is shown with parentheses, the value reported in the XBRL document should still be positive, other than as described in the following sentence. In some limited cases, if the value also has a specified member associated with it, the value may be negative (e.g., when an element is used for an adjustment or elimination, the value may need to be negative).  

If the value reported in the HTML document is shown in parentheses (e.g., interest expense or loss on disposition of assets), you may use a negated label to present the value in parenthesis in the SEC Interactive Data viewer without changing the positive value reported in the XBRL document. The value reported in the XBRL document (e.g., interest expense or loss on disposition of assets) should be the same as the value reported in the HTML document, even though the value in the HTML document is shown in parenthesis. Therefore, it is an error to change the value reported in the XBRL document to a negative solely because the value reported in the HTML document is shown in parenthesis.  

## Problem solved by the rule
Filers continue to have incorrect negative amounts in files, which is inconsistent with the balance types and definitions of the elements used and the structure of the IFRS Taxonomy. Incorrect values in a filing makes it difficult or impossible to use that data for automated analysis.  

## Rule specification

Let **non-negative concepts** be the set concepts defined in columns J and K of [DQC_0080_ListOfElements.xlsx](DQC_0080_ListOfElements.xlsx?raw=true).

Let **sub-string exclusions** be the set of strings defined in column J of  [DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx](DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx?raw=true) where the value of column G is "Member element name contains the text (Case insensitive)".

Let **excluded axes** be the set of axes defined in column J of [DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx](DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx?raw=true) where the value of column G is "Axis equals" and column K is empty.

Let **excluded axis/member pairs** be the set of axis/member pairs, defined in columns J, M and N of [DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx](DQC_0080_MemberExclusions.xlsx?raw=true) where the value of column G is "Axis equals" and column K is "AND member equals".

If a fact in the report has a concept in **non-negative concepts** then its value MUST NOT be negative unless:

* the fact has a dimension with a non-default value that is in the set of **excluded axis/member pairs**; or
* the fact has a dimension and member that is in the set of **excluded axes**; or 
* any string in **sub-string exclusions** is a case-insensitive substring of the local name of any non-default dimension member applied to the fact.
