# IFRS Transition Elements  
Rule ID: DQC_0173  
Status: Final  
Release date: January 16, 2024  
Effective date: May 16, 2024  
  
## Rule function

This rule identifies concepts in the IFRS taxonomy that are being transitioned and that should not be used in filings after 2023-01-01. The rule identifies these concepts by looking for elements with a reference part with the following text:

"This element should be used to tag non-restated comparative information only."

The rule identifies all facts using these transition elements and flags an error.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule ensures that filers update the values associated with these elements in prior filings with the elements that are relevant in 2024.    

### Example rule message
