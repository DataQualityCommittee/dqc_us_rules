Rule ID: DQC_0044  
Status:  Final  
Release date: October 4, 2017  
Effective date: June 1, 2018  

## Rule function

Accrual-based concepts used on the income statement or the statement of stockholders' equity should not be included in the investing and financing sections of the cash flow statement of a company's XBRL filing.  

This rule tests whether a presentation child element of IncomeStatementAbstract and StatementOfStockholdersEquityAbstract from the US-GAAP taxonomy is used as a child of any of the following elements in the company's calculation linkbase:

1.  NetCashProvidedByUsedInInvestingActivities
2.  NetCashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivities
3.  NetCashProvidedByUsedInInvestingActivitiesContinuingOperations
4.  NetCashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivitiesContinuingOperations

## Problem solved by the rule

This rule identifies whether accrual based elements that are intended to be used on the income statement or the statement of stockholder's equity have been used inappropriately on the cash flow statement.  

## Example rule message

The concept Licenses Revenue, with a value of -360,000, is an accrual-based item in the US GAAP taxonomy that is included in the sum of Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities in the cash flows of the extension taxonomy.  

Accrual-based concepts should not be included in the investing section of the cash flows statement of the extension taxonomy. Replace Licenses Revenue with an appropriate US GAAP taxonomy cash flows item, if available or, if not, consider extending a concept.
