# Nil Values on Typed Axis
Rule ID: DQC_0074  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 10, 2018  
Effective date: January 1, 2019 

## Rule function 
This rule identifies when a nil value has been used inappropriately on a typed axis.  The following typed axis cannot have a value of nil.  

1. RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionStartDateAxis

The rule reports an error for every fact that has a nil member associated with it.  

## Problem solved by the rule
A nil value is often added to a typed dimension to represent the default value. In the case of revenue recognition the FASB requires that the default value is represented without an axis with a nil value. In effect, adding a nil value creates alternative methods to define the same fact value. For this reason nil values on a typed dimension should be avoided.  

### Scope of the Rule
This rule applies to all US GAAP Taxonomies issued in 2017 and later.  

## Example rule message
The element us-gaap:RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligation with a value of 3,900,000,000 has been tagged with the axis RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionStartDateAxis with a nil value as a member. This element should be reported without using this axis.
