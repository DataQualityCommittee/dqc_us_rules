# Conditional NonNegs  
Rule ID: DQC_0174  
Status: Final  
Release date: October 5, 2023  
Effective date: December 1, 2023  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where filers have reported a negative value for the concept FinancingReceivableAllowanceForCreditLossesIndividuallyEvaluatedForImpairment1. This value however can be negative if the negative value does not exceed the values of FinancingReceivableAllowanceForCreditLossesCollectivelyEvaluatedForImpairment or FinancingReceivableAllowanceForCreditLossExcludingAccruedInterest.

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule identifies where the value is negative but does not produce false positives where in some cases the value can be netted against the collectively evaluated for impairment  element.    

### Example rule message
The concept FinancingReceivableAllowanceForCreditLossesIndividuallyEvaluatedFor Impairment1 has a value of -100,000 which is less than zero. This element should not have a negative value. The preparer should consider if the value is input correctly for this assertion and, after considering the appropriateness of the input, if incorrect, input the amount as a positive (i.e., absolute) value and provide a negated label.
