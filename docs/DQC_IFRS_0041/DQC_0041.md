# Axis with a Default Member that Differs from the Base Taxonomy  

## Rule function
This rule evaluates whether the dimension default is associated with a given axis in the company's extension taxonomy.  Companies should not change the default member defined in the base taxonomy for a given axis in their extension taxonomy.  

When using an IFRS taxonomy, the axis ContinuingAndDiscontinuedOperationsAxis is not checked to determine if the default domain  was changed.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>

## Problem solved by the rule
Users of the data do not expect that the default member will be changed and assume that any value reported with an axis has the same default member across all filers.  For example, if a company reports a value of Revenues with no dimensions it is assumed that this represents revenues of the consolidated entity.  However, if the company changed the default member of the Legal Entity axis to the parent company member then every value without a dimension would represent the parent company and not the revenue of the consolidated entity.  

## Example rule message
The dimension default defined for the axis in the base taxonomy should not be changed in a company extension taxonomy. The default for the DebtInstrumentAxis in the base taxonomy is DebtInstrumentNameDomain, but the default has been replaced with DebtInstrumentDomain.   
Rule version: 16.0

### Message template

Rule version: 16.0
