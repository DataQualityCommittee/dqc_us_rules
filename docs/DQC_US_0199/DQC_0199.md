Rule ID: DQC_0199
Status: Proposed  
Release date: Nov 30, 2024  
Effective date: Jan 15, 2025

## Rule Function

The rule ensures that investment schedules are completed correctly by checking for the presence of both the spread and the rate basis for variable rate investments. Here is the detailed rule function:

The rule ensures that when a filer reports the spread of a variable rate investment, they also report the rate basis for that investment. This is crucial for providing complete and accurate information about variable rate investments.

**Conditions:**

The rule checks for the existence of a concept representing the spread of a variable rate investment (InvestmentBasisSpreadVariableRate) with any investment identifier axis and unit.
It then checks for the existence of a corresponding concept representing the rate basis (InvestmentVariableInterestRateTypeExtensibleEnumeration) with the same investment identifier axis and unit.
If the spread is reported without the rate basis, the rule triggers an error.


## Problem Solved by the Rule

This rule ensures that filers provide complete information about variable rate investments by reporting both the spread and the rate basis, thereby enhancing the accuracy and completeness of investment schedules.

## Example Rule Message

The filer has reported a value for the concept InvestmentBasisSpreadVariableRate with a value of 0.02. This concept is used to report the spread of a variable rate investment. The filer has not reported the rate basis for this investment. Please ensure that the rate basis is reported for this investment.
