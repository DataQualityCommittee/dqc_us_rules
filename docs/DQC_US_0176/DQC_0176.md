# US-GAAP Elements used in IFRS Filings 
Rule ID: DQC_0176  
Status: Public Exposure November 15 - December 15, 2023 - provide comment at https://xbrl.us/public-review  
Release date: TBD  
Effective date: TBD  
  
## Rule function
This rule identifies where filers have reported a US-GAAP element in an IFRS filing. The rule has two components.  The first checks where a US-GAAP fact has been reported and the second identifies where a US-GAAP element has been used in the presentation linkbase. The rule identifies those elements that have a namespace that contains the string ''http://fasb.org/us-gaap/'.
If an element has this namespace then an error will be produced for the concept used as well as any facts that have been reported that a use a primary concept from the US-GAAP namespace. 

## Problem solved by the rule  
The rule identifies where filers have inadvertently included the US-GAAP taxonomy in an IFRS filing and have used incorrect elements.
