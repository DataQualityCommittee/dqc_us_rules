## Rule Function

**Purpose:** 

**Purpose:**

The purpose of Rule DQC_0209 is to ensure that all required extensible enumeration elements, such as `InvestmentIndustrySectorExtensibleEnumeration`, are properly reported in the Schedule of Investments (SOI). This rule validates that investments disclosed on the `InvestmentIdentifierAxis` include the necessary extensible enumeration values to identify key attributes, such as the industry sector or other relevant classifications. By enforcing the inclusion of these elements, the rule ensures accurate, complete, and consistent tagging of investment data, preventing omissions that could lead to incomplete or unclear financial disclosures.

**Conditions:**

The rule will run on all filings that include schedule of investment disclosures.

## Problem Solved by the Rule

The problem solved by Rule DQC_0209 is ensuring that all required extensible enumeration elements, such as InvestmentIndustrySectorExtensibleEnumeration, are properly reported in the Schedule of Investments (SOI). Specifically, it addresses cases where investments disclosed on the InvestmentIdentifierAxis are missing key extensible enumeration values that identify important attributes, such as the industry sector or other classifications. Omitting these values can lead to incomplete, unclear, or inconsistent financial disclosures, making it difficult for users of the financial statements to fully understand the nature and classification of the investments. This rule ensures that all necessary extensible enumeration elements are included, promoting accurate and complete tagging of investment data.
