# Incorrect Calculation Weights in Operating Cash Flows  
Rule ID: DQC_0043  
Status:  Final  
Release date: OCtober 4, 2017  
Effective date: April 2, 2018  

## Rule function

The rule identifies the balance type of the elements in the calculation linkbase that are children of the operating cash flow elements in the US GAAP taxonomy, specifically the elements NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities or NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivitiesContinuingOperations and determines whether their effective calculation weights are accurate. The effective calculation weight is the calculation weight of the child element relative to operating cash flow element irrespective of the level the child element exists at in the calculation hierarchy. The rule flags an error in the following conditions:

*   If the child element of an operating cash flow element has a debit balance type and a negative effective calculation weight.
*   If the child element of an operating cash flow element has a credit balance type and a positive effective calculation weight. (See exceptions below)

There are a number of exceptions to this rule, specifically net income elements which are the starting point for the calculation of operating cash flow and will be a credit item with a positive balance. Therefore any net income related children are excluded from the rule. These are as follows:

The rule should report every fact associated with the child element in the XBRL instance. This is because once the calculation weight is changed the sign of the reported values will need to be changed.

When the elements NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivitiesContinuingOperations_<u>and</u> _NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities both appear in the calculation linkbase then the rule should only be run for NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities.

## Problem solved by the rule

In the cash flow statement a number of items will roll up into Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Because the parent element NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities has no balance attribute, the calculation weights are not checked in XBRL specification validation. This means that filers can use any weight they like on the child elements and an XBRL error will not result. Historically, a large number of companies have used an incorrect weight on the calculation and as a result the element being added into Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities has an incorrect sign (i.e. Is negative when it should be positive). In the example rule message below, the filer has used the element provision for doubtful accounts with a negative value when it should have been positive. This issue cannot be solved using a negative rule, as the element could justifiably be entered with a negative value in some cases.

## Example rule message

The concept Provision For Doubtful Accounts is included in the calculation of Net Cash Provided By Used In Operating Activities. Provision For Doubtful Accounts is a debit balance type concept representing a natural cash inflow in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Net Cash Provided By Used In Operating Activities.

A debit balance type concept should always be assigned a positive one (+1) calculation weight, as it is an addition to net income (loss) to reconcile to Net Cash Provided By Used In Operating Activities. Provision For Doubtful Accounts has been incorrectly provided a negative one (-1) calculation weight in the extension taxonomy.

Correct the calculation weight to positive one (+1) and input the value as a positive amount.

### Message template

_<u>Template for children of NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities</u>_

The concept ${fact1.label} is included in the calculation of ${NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities.label}. ${fact1.label} is a ${fact1.balance} balance type concept representing a natural cash inflow in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to ${NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities.label}.

A ${fact1.balance} balance type concept should always be assigned a ${if fact1.balance = debit THEN "positive one (+1)" ELSE if fact1.balance = credit THEN "negative one (-1)" } calculation weight, as it is ${if fact1.balance = debit THEN "an addition" ELSE if fact1.balance = credit THEN "a subtraction" } to net income (loss) to reconcile to Net Cash Provided By Used In Operating Activities. ${fact1.label} has been incorrectly provided a ${if fact1.balance = credit THEN "positive one (+1)" ELSE if fact1.balance = debit THEN "negative one (-1)" } calculation weight in the extension taxonomy.

Correct the calculation weight to ${if fact1.balance = debit THEN "positive one (+1)" ELSE if fact1.balance = credit THEN "negative one (-1)" } and input the value as a positive amount.
