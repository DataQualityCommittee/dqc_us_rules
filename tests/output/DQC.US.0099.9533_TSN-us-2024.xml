All elements appearing in the face of the financial statements should be included in a calculation relationship somewhere in the filing. Items not included in the financial statement calculations but included in the presentation are referred to as parenthetical items. These usually appear as a referenced item, or as a value in parenthesis describing that the value reported includes another specific amount.  These values should be reported in a seperate link role for parenthetical items.

This rule will produce an error irrespective of a fact value being entered for the item(s) listed above.
If the item is an additional disclosure in the income statement statement then make sure that is included as a child of one of the following abstract items:
ShareBasedCompensationAllocationAndClassificationInFinancialStatementsAbstract, 
SupplementalIncomeStatementElementsAbstract
