Nature of Operations, 2018-09-01 to 2018-11-30 is not consistent with the Document Fiscal Period Focus with a value of Q2. This period focus expects text block items and dei elements to have at least a period duration between 155 days and 205 days.

If this filing is for a Foreign Private Issuer and is a transitional report then create a boolean extension element called TransitionReport with a value of true. (This extension element is needed as the dei taxonomy does not include an element that indicates if the report is for a transitional period).
