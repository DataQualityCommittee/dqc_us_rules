The value of the concept ifrs-full:NetAssetsLiabilities of 2,467,000,000  should be equal to the sum of its child components defined in the calculation linkbase. The sum of these child components is -4,372,000,000. The values of the addends is determined by adding the values of the child concepts with a decimal value of -6. All values in the financial statements should use the same decimal value. The values reported in the financial statement in the current reporting period of 2021-12-31 should be complete if the financial statement is to be mathematically accurate and complete. The components of ifrs-full:NetAssetsLiabilities that should add to 2,467,000,000 are comprised of the following:

-  	Equity                                                                                                     2,467,000,000
-  	Liabilities                                                                                                1,905,000,000


The addends are calculated based on the calculation linkbase defined for 1004 - Statement - Consolidated balance sheet. If addends are missing then the calculation tree should be amended. The rule will not add dimension components as the financial statement does not include a table. If dimensions are used on the statement then add a table to ensure that the dimensions are defined correctly.
