    * Select the the "DQC.py" file (under "Validate"). Next to the file, the name will appear as "DQC Rules Validator". Click on "Ok". 
    * The "Select Plug-in Module" will close. On the "Plug-in Manager" dialog click on "Close".
	* When the dialogue box appears requesting a program restart, choose "Yes".
* Choose the "Tools" menu and "Validation" and confirm there is a check mark for "DQC Rules". If not, select this item from the menu.

## Checking a filing with DQC Rules

* Choose the "File" menu and either "Open file" or "Open Web" to select an XBRL .zip file from local computer or SEC EDGAR system.
* Select the .xml file (instance document) from the view of the contents of the .zip.
* After the instance has rendered in Arelle, choose the "Tools" >> "Validation" menu and select "Validate".
* Monitor the "messages" window at the bottom of Arelle, to see _[DQC] Starting DQC validation - xxx.xml_ appears.
