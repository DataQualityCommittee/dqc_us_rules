## Documentation definitions

The rules definitions make reference to the following terms:

* The **report taxonomy** is the DTS of XBRL Report, and includes the extension taxonomy.
* The **base taxonomy** is the IFRS taxonomy corresponding to the ruleset version.  The entry point used for each ruleset is shown below.

## IFRS Entry Points

The following entry points define the _base taxonomy_ for each version of the ruleset:

| Version | Entry point |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ESEF DQR 2019 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2019-03-27/full_ifrs_entry_point_2019-03-27.xsd` |
| ESEF DQR 2020 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2020-03-16/full_ifrs_entry_point_2020-03-16.xsd` | 
| ESEF DQR 2021 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2021-03-24/full_ifrs_entry_point_2021-03-24.xsd` | 

## Reference implementation

A reference implementation of the ESEF DQR rules is also available.  The reference implementation is defined using the [XULE language](https://xbrl.us/home/use/what-is-xule) developed by XBRL US.  The language is free to use, and an open source [XULE engine](https://github.com/xbrlus/xule/releases/latest) is available for the [Arelle](https://arelle.org/pub) XBRL processor.
