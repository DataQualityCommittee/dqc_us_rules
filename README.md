## Documentation definitions

The rules definitions make reference to the following terms:

* The **extension taxonomy** is the DTS of XBRL Report against which the rules are being evaluated.
* The **base taxonomy** is the IFRS taxonomy corresponding to the ruleset version.  The entry point used for each ruleset is shown below.
* **Monetary** concepts are concepts with a datatype of, or derived from, `xbrli:monetaryItemType`.
* A set of facts are **dimensionally aligned** if they share the same value for all [dimensions](https://www.xbrl.org/Specification/oim/REC-2021-10-13/oim-REC-2021-10-13.html#term-dimension).  Note that this definition refers to the [OIM](https://www.xbrl.org/Specification/oim/REC-2021-10-13/oim-REC-2021-10-13.html) definition of dimension, and so includes the core dimensions such as period and unit, as well as taxonomy-defined dimensions.

## IFRS Entry Points

The following entry points define the _base taxonomy_ for each version of the ruleset:

| Version | Entry point |
| ------- | ----------- | 
| ESEF DQR 2022 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2022-03-24/full_ifrs_entry_point_2022-03-24.xsd` |  
| ESEF DQR 2021 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2021-03-24/full_ifrs_entry_point_2021-03-24.xsd` |
| ESEF DQR 2020 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2020-03-16/full_ifrs_entry_point_2020-03-16.xsd` |
| ESEF DQR 2019 | `http://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/2019-03-27/full_ifrs_entry_point_2019-03-27.xsd` |

## Reference implementation

A reference implementation of the ESEF DQR rules is also available.  The reference implementation is defined using the [XULE language](https://xbrl.us/home/use/what-is-xule) developed by XBRL US.  The language is free to use, and an open source [XULE engine](https://github.com/xbrlus/xule/releases/latest) is available for the [Arelle](https://arelle.org/pub) XBRL processor.
