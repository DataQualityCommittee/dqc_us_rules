# Data Quality Committee Rules &amp; Guidance

The following automated checks have been drawn from experience with IFRS filings to the SEC and form the initial XBRL International Data Quality Rules in the Beta Release. To review human-readable versions of the validations in this release, click any of the files linked in the "Number" column below. 

These freely-available automated checks are written in an [open-source processing language (XULE)](https://xbrl.us/home/use/what-is-xule) that is used for XBRL business rules, rendering, and data collection activities. XULE is available as a plug-in for the free [Arelle](https://arelle.org/pub) processor, and works with the ruleset.zip files maintained here on ESEF filings.
