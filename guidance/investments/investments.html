<h2>Investment Guidance FAQ</h2></div>

<div>This guidance is intended to supplement the guidance provided by the FASB Implementation guide Financial Instrumentsâ€”Debt Securities.</div>
<br/>
<div class="question">Q1.In the case below where the breakdown of available securities has subtotals should the company use the Investment Type Axis to represent those subtotals of Amortized cost?</div>
    
    <iframe src="https://csuite.xbrl.us/php/dispatch.php?Task=xbrlFactID&FactID=251259308&ReplaceText=4,478" width="958" height="370" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" scrolling="no" title="XULE - Default Filters"></iframe></script>
   <br/>
    <div>In this case the values for short term investments and cash equivalents should be tagged using the <span class="qname">FinancialInstrumentAxis</span> with a member to represent the subtotal. The member representing the subtotal should be nested with children of the members representing the financial instruments comprising that sub total. This ensures that the values reported for the amortized cost will all use the axis <span class="qname">FinancialInstrumentAxis</span> and the concept <span class="qname">AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis</span>.</div>
<br/>
    <div class="question">Q2. In the example above the company has reported cash as part of the investment schedule. Should the value of 849 be tagged with the CashMember on the FinancialInstrumentAxis or should it be tagged with the concept Cash?</div>
<br/>
    <div>The value of cash should not be not be included in the aggregate total of <span class="qname">AvailableForSaleSecuritiesDebtSecurities</span> or <span class="qname">AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis</span>. In the case above the value of $5,992 should be tagged with <span class="qname">CashCashEquivalentsAndShortTermInvestments</span>. The value of $849 should be tagged with the concept Cash. For the amortized cost including cash an extension element will have to be used. Many companies have defined extension elements for this, however the standard extension element <span class="qname">CashAndAvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis</span> should be used.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="question"></div>Q3. Should securities representing Cash and cash equivalents be included as part of AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis? </div>
    <br/>
    <div>Yes.</div>
    <div class="question">Q4. In the following example the company has included the estimated value of equity securities in the table. What element should these values for Equity Securities be tagged with? </div>
