"This rule reflects updated guidance from the data quality committee which contradicts with historical rules. This is a change based on the changes in the cashflow ASU published by FASB.
 The element {$fact.name}  has been reported with a value of {$fact}. However no value has been reported for either the element(s) NetCashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivities and CashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivitiesDiscontinuedOperations. 
It is expected that if the element {$fact.name}  is reported then values would be reported for these corresponding elements. If the value of {$fact} represents the value of NetCashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivities then this more general element should be used as it is a required disclosure.

The properties of this {$fact.concept} fact are:
Period :{$fact.period}
Dimensions : {$fact.dimensions.join(', ','=')}
