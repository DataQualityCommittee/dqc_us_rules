RULE-NAME-PREFIX DQC

/** WHere company has used PAID AMOUNT incorrectly **/

/** The amount paid for acquisitions is a duration item and should reflect the amount paid for the acquisition.  Generally this should be reported  
** by each individual acquisition.  However some companies report it with no members and a very specific date. This tends to indicate it is the amount for a specific
** purchase and as such should have an acqusition member. 

** This rule looks at the total price paid and determines if the amount as an associated acquisition member and if it doesnt then determines that the period matches
** the current reporting period.
** An example filing that is detected is:
** https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/859737/000085973720000018/holxq2-2020.htm or https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859737/000085973720000018/holxq2-2020.htm 
** Entered value for purchase but was as default.
