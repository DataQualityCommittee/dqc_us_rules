If the difference is due to an extension reconciliation item, then the filer should add a calculation relationship. The calculation tree should show the parent element as FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue with children of FinanceLeaseLiabilityUndiscountedExcessAmount + FinanceLeaseLiability + any extension items. There should already be a calculation tree defined for the components of FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue comprised of FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDueNextTwelveMonths +  FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDueYearTwo etc.  These two beakdowns of FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue should be in seperate calculation groups. If an extension item appears as a child calculation of FinanceLeaseLiabilityPaymentsDue then no error is produced.
