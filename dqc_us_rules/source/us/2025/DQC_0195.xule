# Facts using an invalid member with the Equity Components Axis
Rule ID: DQC_0195
Status: Final  
Release date: Oct 15, 2024  
Effective date: Nov 30, 2024

## Rule Function
The rule checks that movements in shareholders equity element are represented with the appropriate member and line item combination.  Specifally the rule checks where values are reported with line items and members that are not appropriate. The rule covers the following situations:
1. Where the CommonStockMember is used with an inappropriate line item.
2. Where the StockholdersEquity line item is reported with a Noncontrolling Interest member.
3. Where line items representing Shares Outstanding and Shares Issued are used with Treasury Stock Members.
4. Where Treasury Stock line items are used with the Common Stock Member.
5. Where stock issued and  stock outstanding are both used with the common stock member.
6. Where the Retained Earnings Members are used with an inappropriate line item.

## Problem Solved by the Rule
 The rule helps to ensure consistency in filings when reporting the statement of stockholders equity.  It also identified where the concept StatementEquityComponentsAxis has been used in the footnotes that does not match what has been reported in the financial statements.

## Example Rule Message 1

us-gaap:StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueTreasuryStockReissued has a value of 31,000 and has been used with the common stock [Member]. This element should not have a value when used with the common stock [Member]. The preparer should consider if the value is input correctly or if a different element or member should be used.

The filer should report one or the other but not both when using the common stock member. If the column representing shares in the Changes in equity represents issued shares then the SharesOutstanding elememnt should not be used with the common stock member. If the column representing shares in the Changes in equity represents outstanding shares then the SharesIssued element should not be used with the common stock member.

/** THis can be super confusingin terms of multiple meanings.  WHats the difference between treasuryStockSharesAqcuired and StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares and the treasury stock member

The issue is further complicated by the fact that common stock for shares can be either outstanding or issued where as the value amount for common stock is not netted for tresury. 

In the notes if you see treasuryStockSharesAqcuired with common stock member then this implies the shares colum is outstanding in the SHE. 

It seems to me none of the treasury share elements should be used if the changes in she uses the shares outstanding rather than the shares issued

An example of this is here : https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/846475/000155837024010200/zyxi-20240630x10q.htm

This filing has treasury but for the shares colum uses shares outstanding and not issued.  In the notes they disclose share buybacks going into treasury.  SHouldnt the elemnts be consistent with the statement of SHE.**/
