"The element ContractWithCustomerLiabilityRevenueRecognized with a value of {$valueRecognized} is greater than the opening balance of ContractWithCustomerLiability with an opening balance of {$openingBalanceOfValueRecognized} on {$openingDate}. The element ContractWithCustomerLiabilityRevenueRecognized represents the amount from the opening balance that was recognized during the period. For this reason it cannot be greater than the opening balance.

If representing the revenue recognized during the period as part of a rollforward including the revenue recognized from the opening balance use the extension concept ContractWithCustomerLiabilityRevenueRecognizedIncludingOpeningBalance. If reporting the revenue recognized during the period that excludes the opening balance use the extension element ContractWithCustomerLiabilityRevenueRecognizedExcludingOpeningBalance.
