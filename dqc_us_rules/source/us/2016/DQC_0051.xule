"{$taxConcept} should not be included in the calculation of IncomeLossIncludingPortionAttributableToNoncontrollingInterest in the group {$network.role.uri}. IncomeLossIncludingPortionAttributableToNoncontrollingInterest is before the deduction of tax. Excluding the tax expense from the amount is inconsistent with the meaning of the element  because this element represents a before tax item and should not be used to represent an after tax item. If IncomeLossIncludingPortionAttributableToNoncontrollingInterest represents  the amount after tax then use NetIncomeLoss instead.
