"{$fact1.concept} has a value of {$fact1} which is less than zero. This element should not have a negative value. The preparer should consider if the value is input correctly for this assertion and, after considering the appropriateness of the input, if incorrect, input the amount as a positive (i.e., absolute) value and provide a negated label, or use the element SubleaseIncome.
