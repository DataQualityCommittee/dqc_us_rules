# Opening and Closing Balances on the Statement of Shareholders Equity
Rule ID: DQC_0196
Status: Final  
Release date: Oct 15, 2024  
Effective date: Nov 30, 2024

## Rule Function
The rule identifies instant elements that have been used in the statement of Shareholders Equity that do not represent the opening and closing balances of Stockholders Equity. The rule identifies those instant facts that are used with the StatementEquityComponentsAxis that do not represent and opening or closing balance of the monetary value of Shareholders Equity or the share value of Stockholders Equity.

## Problem Solved by the Rule
The rule identifies where filers use the more specific instant elements in the Statement of Stockholders Equity, such as AdditionalPaidInCapital or RetainedEarningsAccumulatedDeficit.  The values using these elements should be tagged with the more generic elements such as StockholdersEquity. This ensures consistency across filings and removes duplicate ways of tagging the same fact. The rule also detects where extensions have been used to represent the opening and closing balances. SHareholders Equity is a standard element and should not be extended.

This fact value has been used with the StatementEquityComponentsAxis and CommonStockMember. This element should not be used to represent an opening or closing balance in the changes of equity.

"{$fact1.concept} has a value of {$fact1} and has been used with the Noncontrolling Interest Member. This fact value has been used with the StatementEquityComponentsAxis and the Noncontrolling Interest Member. When an instant element is  used with the StatementEquityComponentsAxis it is typically used to represent the opening and closing balance in the changes of equity. The element  {$fact1.concept}  should not be used to represent an opening or closing balance in the changes of equity. Rather an element such as one of the following standard elements should be used {$exclusionList.join(',')}. Please remove the member from this fact or consider using one of the standard elements to represent the opening or closing balance of NCI.
