/** THis can be super confusingin terms of multiple meanings.  WHats the difference between treasuryStockSharesAqcuired and StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares and the treasury stock member

The issue is further complicated by the fact that common stock for shares can be either outstanding or issued where as the value amount for common stock is not netted for tresury. 

In the notes if you see treasuryStockSharesAqcuired with common stock member then this implies the shares colum is outstanding in the SHE. 

It seems to me none of the treasury share elements should be used if the changes in she uses the shares outstanding rather than the shares issued

An example of this is here : https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/846475/000155837024010200/zyxi-20240630x10q.htm

This filing has treasury but for the shares colum uses shares outstanding and not issued.  In the notes they disclose share buybacks going into treasury.  SHouldnt the elemnts be consistent with the statement of SHE.**/
