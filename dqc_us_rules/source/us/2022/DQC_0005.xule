"The element Entity Common Stock Shares Outstanding with a value of {$fact1} is used to report the Entity Common Stock Shares Outstanding as stated on the cover sheet of the entity's filing. However, the value reported is not as of the latest practicable date, as required. In this case, {$fact1.name} with a value of {$fact1} is reported as of {$shares_at_date}. This is earlier than the actual reporting date of the filing.

Update the date context on this fact, so that the date is at least later than {$MAXIMUM_PERIOD_END_DATE}, which is the reporting [end] date of the filing based on the defined dates of the Document Type element.
