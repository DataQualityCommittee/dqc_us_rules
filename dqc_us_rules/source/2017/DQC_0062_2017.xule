MESSAGE
"The filing includes a cash flow statement but does not report a value for the change in cash using any of the following elements:

CashCashEquivalentsRestrictedCashAndRestrictedCashEquivalentsPeriodIncreaseDecreaseIncludingExchangeRateEffect (After adoption of ASU-2016-18)  
CashCashEquivalentsRestrictedCashAndRestrictedCashEquivalentsPeriodIncreaseDecreaseExcludingExchangeRateEffect (After adoption of ASU-2016-18)  
CashPeriodIncreaseDecrease,CashAndCashEquivalentsPeriodIncreaseDecrease  (Prior to adoption of ASU-2016-18)
CashAndCashEquivalentsPeriodIncreaseDecreaseExcludingExchangeRateEffect (Prior to adoption of ASU-2016-18) or 
NetCashProvidedByUsedInContinuingOperations (As long as the element NetCashProvidedByUsedInDiscontinuedOperations is also included the reconciliation between opening and closing cash)

If you have disclosed a change in cash for the period, one of the above elements should be used.  Please update your filing if one of the following has occurred:

1. The change in cash has not been represented with a value, in this case the element should be tagged with a value of zero. 
2. The change in cash flow is dimensionally qualified with an inappropriate dimension. The instance should have a value reported with no dimensions. The rule will identify where the successor member has been used or an extension member. The value for change in cash should not have a dimension.
3. The change in cash has been represented with an extension element. There is no reason the change in cash needs to be identified using an extension element.
